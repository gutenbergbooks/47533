<h2><a name="Appreciation" id="Appreciation"></a>Rosegger: An Appreciation<span class="pageno"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> unmistakable trend of our time is the civilisation&mdash;which,
in its modern form, is largely urbanisation&mdash;of
the whole habitable globe. From its centres outwards
it is thrusting itself upon places, men, processes&mdash;ultimate
sanctuaries, never before reached by alien trespassing.
Most men are looking on at its destruction of
the old order with shrugging acceptance of the inevitable,
or hailing the chaotic stuff of the new in its making with
so far unjustified joy. With a wit worn somewhat threadbare
with use they invariably counsel the few eccentrics
who deny its inevitability and question its beneficence to
quit the hopes and mops of Mrs. Partington for the discreet
submission of the wiser Canute. Then they grow properly
grave, and declare that this modern civilisation, for all
its shortcomings, has been well described as a banquet,
the like of which, for those below as for those above the
salt, has never been spread before. However that may
be, there is no question that here and there a guest
is sometimes moved to look round on the company and
scan its several types with a sudden sense of their significance.
Some of these, good and bad, are common to all
late civilisations, he perceives, others as hatefully peculiar
to our own as certain diseases. Where, in God's name, were
there ever till now men like these, who bend a complaisant
spectacled gaze on a world going under, content
if they may but first secure their museum sample (including
one carefully chosen, perfectly embalmed, stuffed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
and catalogued peasant) of every species? Or their
younger kindred&mdash;men whose intellect obeys no inspiration
save curiosity nor law save its own limit, whose
inventions, therefore, cannot foster good and beauty but
only spoil these in Nature and men's souls? As for
that splendid group beyond, one may question if Athens,
Rome, or Byzantium, whose sumptuous culture of brain
and body achieved an almost criminal comeliness by
Christian standards, ever equalled them: question, too,
whether their selfish perfection or the travesty of it in
this mob of women dull with luxury, of men brutalised
by the scramble of getting it for them&mdash;be less desirable
for the race! Thankfully his eye passes from them
to those who turn such a cold shoulder upon their
vulgarity: a little company, fine-edged, polished and
flexible with perpetual fence of wit and word, hardly
peculiar to our day perhaps, but rather such as might have
played their irresponsible game on the eve of any red
revolution. Now and again they lend an amused ear to
various gassy gospels over the way, where, as he perceives,
he is once more among the children of this latter day
alone: notably certain insignificances who, because they
have raised their self-indulgence to the dignity of a
problem play, are solemnly mistaking themselves (as
actors and audience too) for pioneers of social progress;
and some earnest women who have slammed the front door
on their nearest and dearest stay-at-home duties and
privileges, to go questing after problematical rights. It
looks, too, as if the same types, modified for worse and
better by class conditions, were repeated below the salt;
but there the multitude is so great that the individuals
are soon lost in a far-off colourless mass&mdash;sometimes a
menacing mass&mdash;by no means so content with stale
bread as the others with caviare.</p>

<p>Is then this civilisation to become the universal order?
he asks himself; and must the world it has laid waste be
repeopled from these? The very fear of it summons a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
shadowy memory of fathers' fathers among Sussex
sheepfolds, Highland crofts, Tuscan vineyards, or German
forests. After that the banquet grits in the teeth
like husks, and there is nothing possible but to
get up and go out from it, sick with longing for those
simpler, saner people. To them, it is said, fatherhood,
motherhood, home, were chiefest of prides and sanctities
outside Heaven. They either kept or consciously broke
the ten commandments, but they never set up the
<i>Seven deadly Sins</i> in their place. They won life out of
the earth, sometimes with difficulty enough, but the
struggle bred a muscle and fortitude only now failing
their descendants in hyper-civilisation. They laboured,
and took their pleasures too, under open skies and in
quiet places where the divine voice could clearly be
heard at times, and unperplexedly obeyed.</p>

<p>Between fear and hope these famished feasters come at
last to the ancestral places; only too often to find them
ruined, or sheltering some sad survival unaware of his
own splendid history. On the cold thresholds they
stand, stricken with the sense of the world's irreparable
loss in a virile and faithful race.</p>

<p>Just so far have many thinking people come to-day,
and there remain, needing a leader who can turn regretful
retrospect to rational hope. Such a one is Peter
Rosegger, whose life is a type of our own day and a
prophecy of better. He, too, left the land for the city,
and now, because all his culture and experience do but
confirm his faith that <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Bauernthum</i> is as necessary for
the world's soul as the bread which the peasant grows
for its body, he has gone back to it. When he wants new
vigour for daily life, or for his mission of protecting and
pleading for a vanishing folk, he touches earth and gets
it. Peasant-born, in most of his books he <em>is</em> Peasantry
grown conscious and articulate,&mdash;he gives us that life from
within. But culture has enabled him to see the peasant
in his true relation to the world as well, to measure the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
life he was born into with the civilisation whose guest
he has been. And so in one invaluable book, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Erdsegen</cite>,
he writes of the folk life from without, and that with
great truth and consistency. The story is given in a
series of letters from a city journalist, who for a frivolous
wager goes to live "the simple life" as a peasant among
peasants for one year. Looking through the townsman's
eyes, we find there no stage-peasant's Arcady, no rose-bowered
cottages pleasantly ready for week-end lodgers;
rather we stare aghast at the coarse food, rough work,
some very unwholesome conditions, and obstinate superstitions.
The journalist's earlier letters treat of these
things with humorous realism, and we respect his
pluck for putting up with them. Gradually the tone
of the letters changes, and we see the innate fineness&mdash;not
the cultured refinement&mdash;of the townsman,
responding to the strong faith behind the superstition,
to the beauty of the traditional labours, the heroic endurance
of their undoing by storm and bad fortune, and
the acceptance of good and ill alike as from the hands of a
good if sometimes incomprehensible Father. The faint
sneer, even the amused smile, die from the townsman's
face; dirt and discomfort are lost sight of in the divine
realities which draw him, humbly enough at last, to
throw in his lot with these humble people.</p>

<p>Rosegger is a true prophet, he never disguises truth in
defending it. His passion for essential Peasantry is too
great for sentimentalities, too honest for whitewash; and
so while he exhilarates us with its elemental force he
does not fear to show where this merges into brutality,
nor when its simplicity opens the door to superstition.
And yet in the end we are one with his faith in
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Bauernthum</i> and the world's need of it. The land-folk who
emigrate to cities, and their children there born, are fast
losing and will soon quite lose what no money or experience
can compensate them for. Age after age, great
shaping influences from the forest, the mountain and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
waters of the mountain, the solitudes, the mastery and
love of beasts, the disciplinary tragedies and triumphs
of agriculture, came and wrought upon the humanity
in their midst, gradually creating the customs, traditions,
lore and art&mdash;everything except religion in its <em>Church</em>
sense&mdash;which is part of the collective soul of Peasantry.
Whatever these uprooted land-folk gain in the city,
though they gain the whole world, they certainly lose
their own soul&mdash;the soul special to Peasantry and until
now the fullest spring of the world's imaginative life.</p>

<p>At times, perhaps when he has stayed too long in
Graz, Rosegger writes of <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Bauernthum</i> as of something
irrevocably passing; at others he utters his faith&mdash;for
it is deeper than hope&mdash;that it will come again. To him
his own life is racially prophetic. He has had the best
of civilisation, intellectual intercourse, fame, travel,
wealth: but from these and all others of its benefits or
lures, he has again and again run back, mastered by
a <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Heimweh</i> which saved him. Sometimes, in terrible
trouble, once at the point of death, he went back, and
every time the touch of the earth renewed him, body
and soul. Signs of this saving <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Heimweh</i> he sees here and
there among those who remain at the banquet, actually
starving in satiety, some of them; and from the quiet
valley where his genius, long since the consecrated
champion of the ancient peasantry, does its best work,
he calls upon these to come back and make possible a
new. His loyal traditionalism does not hinder his belief
that a new peasantry, not born, but becoming such
from a choice inspired by heart's hunger and a surfeit
of civilisation, must have a strong redemptive value of
its own among the decadent nations.</p>

<p>Of the earth he writes as he wrote of the stern tender
woman who bore him in the Forest Farm,&mdash;with a worship
that makes a town-bred creature drag at his chain or
break his heart to run home to her. She has never failed
him, he says, in any need of spirit or flesh, nor will she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
ever fail her prodigals. When they come back in a
hundred or a thousand years they will find her patiently
waiting to teach them all the vital forgotten things over
again: and, even if she take the gewgaws and lumber out
of their hands, she will leave them whatever of learning
she can with her ancient processes and gift of wonder
transmute into wisdom.</p>

<span class="small">A Biographical Note</span></h2>

<p class="center inc">By Dr. Julius Petersen</p>


<h3>I</h3>

<p class="cap2"><span class="upper">In</span> the heart of Austria lies Steiermark (Styria), a
rough mountain country on the eastern slope of
the Alps. Its inhabitants, protected from the levelling
influences of modern civilisation and cut off from
that mingling with other peoples which destroys racial
character, have retained their old individuality and
customs longer than any other German people. Rough
though the climate is, the soil stony, the struggle
for existence hard, these sons of the mountains have
grown stubbornly inseparable from their home; it is
with difficulty that they take root in other soil&mdash;they are
evermore drawn back to the place where once their
cradle stood. In former centuries the Swiss soldiers in
French service could not hear the home-like chime of
cow-bells without a temptation to desert their colours;
and time after time sons of Steiermark have been driven
back to their free hills by the constraint of garrison life.
The deserters were always easily caught: the sergeant
in pursuit had simply to look for the culprit in his father's
house. The <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Heimweh</i> (other languages can hardly express
the meaning of this word) is the national sickness to
which all natives of the Alps driven into foreign parts
are subject, and it is but the other side of that impassioned
joy in the home, which finds expression in
jubilant songs and shouts rising for ever from the mountains
to the sky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>Peter Rosegger is the national poet of Styria. If it
can be said that all men on their way through life carry
with them a clod of home-soil, as the pious pilgrim
carries a handful of sacred earth, then one may say
that this poet is home personified. "Styria on two
legs," he is called by his own people. All that can move
the soul of this people, from the lightest jest to the
deepest longings and searchings, has found expression
in his writings.</p>

<p>He has passed through many phases of life, from peasant
to craftsman, to schoolmaster, to theologian, and
all these phases are reflected in his life-work. The son
of the peasant, who on his journey has attained the
heights of humanity, is always turning back to his
starting-point. Like the old giant Antæus, he draws new
strength from his mother Earth. Close touch with the
home soil is for him a condition of life. When Rosegger
was on a lecturing tour through the great German cities,
where he was enthusiastically greeted by audiences of
thousands, there never left him the longing for the
silent peace of the mountains; and <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Heimweh</i> drove him
away even from the shining Gulf of Naples. Even Graz,
the beautiful capital of Steiermark, where Rosegger has
his vine-covered house, cannot take the place of home
for him. In the summer months he escapes to Krieglach
in the Mürztal; there he lives among his native people,
and from his window he looks out to those heights where,
out of sight, stands a deserted farm&mdash;his birthplace.</p>

<p>In Alpl, near Krieglach, a forest community which has
now almost ceased to exist and even at the time of his
birth consisted only of twenty-three farms, Rosegger
came into the world on July 31st, 1843. It was almost
by accident that he learnt to read and to write. An old
schoolmaster, whom the Church had dismissed from his
office because of his leanings towards freedom in 1848,
wandered a beggar through the mountains, and when he
came to the peasants of Alpl they said: "Beggars we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
have anyhow in plenty, but a schoolmaster we have not
and never have had since the world began. He shall be
schoolmaster here, and our children shall learn to read
and to write; if it does no good, it can do no harm."
And so the old schoolmaster went hawking his learning
from house to house, and his school fees consisted of the
right to eat as much as ever he liked.</p>

<p>Peter, the son of the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wald-bauer</i> (forest peasant),<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> was
soon known for his learning. Once in the dead of winter
he was taken to one of the highest-lying farms, where the
old peasant owner wanted to make her will. There being
neither paper nor ink, he wrote the will with charcoal
inside a coffer lid, for the boy was gifted with a
bright mother-wit which never left him at a loss. He
read everything printed that he could lay hands on, but
as he did not find enough to read, he began to write
himself; stories of saints, sermons, works of devotion
and calendars. These he illustrated with drawings of
his own invention. A student who had spent his holidays
in the mountains had left him a little box of watercolours.
The boy cut a lock of hair from his own head,
bound it to a little stick, and so made himself a brush
with which to paint his pictures of his saints. This story
is a symbol of all Rosegger's achievement of learning.
However much outside help he may have received, he
may thank himself for the best, after all. "My little
saddle-horse," says he, "has never fed upon the dry hay
of school-knowledge, but only on the green grass of life
itself. The little that I know, Life has taught me, and
the little that I can do, Necessity. The inability to express
myself by word of mouth has taught me to write,
and my desire to share that written word with others
taught me to read. As the father of a family, with a very
uncertain income, I learnt arithmetic; as a herdsman on
the pasture land, zoology; as farmer and stonecutter,
mineralogy; as hay-maker and woodcutter, botany.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>Geography I learnt in travelling; history from events
which followed one another as cause and consequence;
folklore I learnt as a travelling journeyman; and astronomy
in sleepless nights, when I lay and looked up
at the stars. Thoughts about physiology, anatomy,
medicine, and patience have come to me in illness;
theology I have turned to in times of need and loneliness;
and law has been learnt in self-examination. Music became
dear to me from the birds of the woods and the
sound of waterfalls. The telling of stories I never learnt
at all. My first baby stammer&mdash;so says our old cousin&mdash;was
a story in Styrian dialect; and my life, according
to the belletristic newspapers, was a romance."</p>

<p>His life, indeed, is rich in wonders, and the evolution
of the peasant boy a sort of fairy tale. Rosegger has
described for us his youth in the form of a novel, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Heidepeters
Gabriel</cite> (1872), in which it all reads like an impossible
romance. Later he has published the story of his life in
a series of autobiographical writings, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Waldheimat</cite> (<cite>The
Forest Home</cite>, 1875); <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Als Ich jung noch war</cite> (<cite>When I was
still young</cite>, 1895); <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Mein Weltleben</cite> (<cite>My Life in the World</cite>,
1898); in these the same course of events is given with
a wonderful truth to life. As documents of a rare human
evolution they may stand on a level with Rousseau's
<cite>Confessions</cite>; they are more lovable, though no less
honest.</p>

<p>The boy very early saw something of the world. As a
little fellow his father took him with him on a pilgrimage
to Maria Zell; his godfather, on another pilgrimage,
pointed out to him the first railway as an uncanny bit
of devil's invention; and on one occasion the eleven-year-old
boy set out alone for Vienna, reaching the Imperial
city after a several days' tramp. His aim was to visit
the Kaiser Josef II, of whose friendliness so many stories
were going about among his people. As a matter of fact,
Josef II had been lying in his grave for more than sixty
years, and his visitor was conducted to his mausoleum.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Later, as he was again wandering in the streets and
casting about how to get home (for of his travelling
money&mdash;the proceeds of the sale of a lamb&mdash;only just
the equivalent of the little beast's tail was left), a bearded
man came up to him and offered him five florins if he
would pose for half an hour in his studio. And, wonder
on wonder, the water-colour which the artist painted
from this sketch now hangs in the Rosegger Room at
Mürzzuschlag, which is the nucleus of a future Rosegger
Museum! Here also is preserved the tailor's goose, which
later the boy, then in his apprenticeship, had to carry
after his master; and beside it is a peasant's waistcoat&mdash;the
same apprentice's claim to journeymanship! It
appears that, though his brothers and sisters all became
farm-workers, the Waldbauer's first-born proved to be
too sickly for the ancestral calling. He was to become a
priest. The parish priest of Birkfeld offered to instruct
him in Latin. Peter, as a candidate for holy orders, was
entrusted to the care of a peasant in that parish. After
three days he ran away in the night&mdash;home-sickness was
too much for him. So in 1860 he became apprentice to a
master-tailor of his own district, and played his part in
his itinerant trade. He worked on more than sixty
farms in the neighbourhood, and in this way learned to
know the life of the people in Styria more intimately
than would have been possible in any other calling. The
inexhaustible wealth of strange character and peasant
originality and the unique acquaintance with the most
ancient and characteristic native customs which Rosegger
displays in his later writings, are the fruit of those years
of close observation.</p>

<p>With the passion for reading grew the desire to write.
One day his master set out, leaving his carefully guarded
paper-patterns lying about. He was accustomed to
apprentices, anxious to become independent, making use
of such an opportunity to copy the patterns for themselves.
His apprentice Peter seized on them too, concerning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
himself with their shape not at all, but only with
the contents of the cut-out newspapers whose stale news
he devoured. This made his master almost despair of
him. "Honesty's a very fine thing, Peter," he said,
"but I can clearly see you'll never be much of a credit
to me. Here you are, waiting from week to week for the
end of your time, and have never yet stolen one pattern
from your master!"</p>

<p>Others, too, prophesied to the youth that he would
never make a proper tailor. Once he had to share quarters
with a shoemaker's apprentice. Then it was that the
little note-book in which he used to write songs of his
own making was discovered. The song which made
Rosegger celebrated, and which as a genuine folk-song
is not only sung in Styria, but all over Germany, was
amongst them: "Darf ih's Dirndl liabe." The beauty
of this song, which is inseparable from its dialect, can
scarcely be rendered in a translation: without the
charming form the idea is almost too primitive. The
boy goes in succession to priest, father, and mother, and
puts the question to them, whether he may love the
maid? Each puts him sharply off until at last he goes
to the Lord God Himself, and there finds sympathy with
his inquiry.</p>

<div class="poem-container">

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Why yes, of course," He smiled and said;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Because of the boy I have made the maid."</span>
</div>

</div>

<p>The shoemaker's apprentice found this moral most enlightening
and determined to send the song to his
sweetheart, but could not believe that the young tailor
could make such verses without having a sweetheart of
his own. "Get along&mdash;and look here, you tell me of
anyone else who can turn out verses like that!" he said
admiringly. "And don't be angry, tailor; I don't
understand much of your trade, but after looking at
your father's new jacket I don't mind telling you that
you'll never make a first-rate tailor. Your song now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
<em>that's</em> a masterpiece if you like. Now, don't you forget,
that down here on the plain and in the farmer's oat-straw
I told you how it would be&mdash;you'll never remain
a tailor. You'll go to the towns and become somebody;
you'll be a bookbinder! Mark my word, in the end
you'll become a bookbinder!"</p>

<p>That was the highest the shoemaker's apprentice
could conceive of. But it soon happened otherwise.
Passing tourists had come across the verses which the
country folk had already set to music, and they encouraged
the author to send certain of them to town. As a result,
the editor of the Graz <cite>Daily Post</cite> took an interest in the
people's poet, and asked him to send him all the poetry
he had written and to give him an account of his life.
Peter packed up, and, carrying a bundle of manuscripts
weighing fifteen pounds, set off on his way to Graz. The
postage for such a parcel would have been quite beyond
his means.</p>



<h3>II</h3>

<p>At the end of 1864 an article appeared in the Graz
<cite>Daily Post</cite>, entitled <cite>A Styrian Poet of the People</cite>, in which
a larger public was called upon to assist the young
talented writer. And now from all quarters sendings
poured into the post office in Krieglach&mdash;congratulations,
books, small sums of money, and provisions. A
bookseller in Leibach offered him an apprenticeship.
Rosegger accepted it, but after a few days <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Heimweh</i>
again drove him from the unfamiliar district. However,
a free scholarship was found for him at the Graz Commercial
Academy; friends and teachers were not wanting,
and here, between the years 1865&ndash;9 the farmer's son,
not yet able, when he entered it, to write correctly, received
an intellectual training which left him no longer
inferior to the well educated. In the same year that he
left this institution his first book, a volume of poems in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
dialect, and entitled <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zither und Hackbrett</cite> (<cite>Zither and
Dulcimer</cite>), was published. A second collection, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Tannenharz
und Fichtennadeln</cite> (<cite>Pine-resin and Fir-needles</cite>), came
out in the following year; and in 1870 also appeared his
first picture of Styrian peasant life, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Sittenbilder aus dem
Steierischen Oberlande</cite>. These won him some fame;
already publishers began to approach him with offers.
And now once more miracle entered his life. In the
summer of 1872 a young and beautiful Graz lady, accompanied
by a friend, made a pilgrimage to the birthplace
of her favourite poet; there by chance she and her
poet met, and a year later they were married. Their
happy life together lasted but a short time; after the
birth of a second child the young wife died. Six years
after his sad loss Rosegger made a second and equally
happy marriage.</p>

<p>About his life since then there is not much to tell.
One fact, however, should be emphasised; namely, that
Rosegger, who in his early years had become indebted
to so many friends, very soon began to pay them back,
and the account has long since been balanced in his
favour and now shows a debit on the other side. Many
a time has he introduced the work of young writers to
the literary world with warm words of recommendation,
just as the distinguished poet Robert Hammerling once
did for his first collection of poems. The greater part of
the profits of his extensive lecture tour have been used
for the public good. Through him, a Catholic, Mürzzuschlag
has got a Protestant church; his home-parish,
Alpl, has for some years now had a school-house of its
own for which it has to thank Rosegger. And only a
short time ago it was his eloquent intervention that
obtained a large contribution for the German School-Society&mdash;a
society which aims at preserving race-characteristics
and culture where they are threatened on the
language frontiers. Were I to give data of his public life
during the last ten years, they would consist of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
services as these, and of the grateful homage which is
rendered him by the many who love and honour him.
But his inner development is revealed in the writings of
his maturity; for Rosegger has written nothing but
what in his inmost heart he has experienced. Since 1876
he has edited a monthly magazine, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Heimgarten</cite>, which is
his public diary. "Heimgarten," he tells us, "is the
name given in various districts to that house in the
Alpine village in which of an evening the village folk
come together, bringing in small handwork to do and
enjoying one another's company. Here are to be found
the brightest of the inhabitants, those readiest in storytelling
and description, those who are men of the world,
or who would like to be such, assembled for educative
and stimulating intercourse. In the Heimgarten, stories
and legends, tragic and comic incidents from life are repeated;
songs and ballads are sung; poems are improvised;
farces and comedies are given, or incidents of the
day and important events in the life of the village or the
wide world are discussed by the village wiseacres. Intercourse
in the Heimgarten enlightens and enriches the
mind, quickens, warms, and ennobles the heart. This
homely type from Alpine village life furnishes the title
and programme for my monthly magazine."</p>

<p>And to this programme the paper, which has become
a home for true national education, has held faithfully
for thirty-four years. Here all stories, articles, and poems
of Rosegger's first appeared, and in this paper he expresses
his views on all vital questions of the day.</p>

<p>"All we poets are foresters and woodwards in the great
forest of mankind," said once Berthold Auerbach, another
poet of the people, to Rosegger. Such a one the editor
of the <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Heimgarten</cite> feels himself to be, expending, as he
does, all his ripe experience and loving care upon the
husbandry which has been entrusted to him. To protect
the vanishing traditional customs of his forefathers, their
natural conceptions of right and wrong, the blessing of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
family life, their healthy contentment&mdash;the outcome of
bodily toil and the love of the home&mdash;against the demoralisation
of modern hyperculture, is his most earnest
aim.</p>

<p>The principal heroes of his romances are by preference
those whose calling involves the task of cherishing and
teaching the people: schoolmasters and priests. The
<cite>Writings of the Forest Schoolmaster</cite> (1878) is the name of
Rosegger's most popular work, which already in 1908
appeared in its seventy-eighth edition, and which, let
us hope, may within the author's lifetime still reach its
hundredth edition. The theme is the gradual emergence
of a forest parish from a group of demoralised and
utterly uneducated men to a social organisation, to a
lawful and religiously organised community. A similar
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Kulturroman</i> is <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Der Gottsucher</cite> (<cite>The God-seeker</cite>, 1883),
which leads us back into past centuries. A parish has
been excommunicated by the Church for murdering its
priest. The people cannot exist without religion, and,
deprived of their old church, they create a new one, a
religion of Nature, by means of which the leader of the
community brings back order and industry to the village.
The third novel belonging to this series, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Das Ewige Licht</cite>
(<cite>The Light Eternal</cite>, 1897), is a pessimistic counterpart
to the <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Waldschulmeister</cite>. This treats of the dangers to
religion which arise from modern civilisation. The faithful
priest of a mountain parish has to look on helplessly
while the modern world thrusts itself into the mountain
idyll; while the atmosphere of the great cities, brought
up by mountain climbers and summer visitors, and the
smoke from the chimneys of the ever-spreading industrialism
in the valleys below, poison the pure air, and,
morally and economically, ruin the old inhabitants.</p>

<p>But the peasantry has yet another enemy: the love of
sport among the nobility. As once Karl Marx, the
theorist of collectivism, studied in Scotland the expropriation
of man from the soil in favour of deer, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
his <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Kapital</cite> exposed the tragic consequences of such
excessive sport, so now Rosegger in his home must look
on at the depopulating of entire villages. By this means
his own birthplace has been nearly ruined. In his first
novel, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Heidepeters Gabriel</cite>, he already shows the hopeless
struggle of the peasant against the devastation of his
fields by game, a struggle which leads to poaching and
to prison. And in his novel <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Jacob der Letzte</cite> (1888),
which, from an artistic point of view, is perhaps the most
complete of his works, the principal character, the last
descendant of an old peasant family, who clings tenaciously
to the old soil, is beaten and goes under in the
struggle. Such a single case becomes for Rosegger an
alarming symptom of the universal decline of the free
peasantry. "What will come of it?" he asks, when he
receives from numerous parts of Germany letters all
witnessing to the same facts: "I am no practical teacher
of political economy, I am only a poet; but they say
that poets are seers, and I verily see that future generations
will have to go home to the land again, that only
on the land can the social question be peacefully
and lastingly solved. Here master and man live on
far more friendly footing than in the city, and come
humanly nearer together. For twenty-five years I have
been preaching in every way the return to natural living.
I have built my little house in a peasant village and I
live right among the peasants.&mdash;I am utterly dissatisfied
with the leading spirits of our time: they don't teach
us to live, they teach us only to think. One thing we
have still to learn&mdash;to forget what they have taught us.
Our true Mother is the Earth: from her spring our bread
and our ideals."</p>

<p>The return of the townspeople to nature forms the
theme of two later novels, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Erdsegen</cite> (<cite>The Earth and the
Fullness Thereof</cite>, 1900) and <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Weltgift</cite> (<cite>The Poison of the
World</cite>, 1903). In the former the editor of a paper pledges
himself to live a whole year as farm-labourer in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
country. He not only earns his wager, but in the course
of the year so richly experiences and realises the blessedness
of life on the land that, cured of the fever of city
life, he marries a village girl and starts his own farm.
This thesis, with its obvious strong purpose, aroused
opposition. The chief objection brought forward was
that it would be impossible for a thoroughly town-bred
person to take such deep root in the country. In reply
to this, Rosegger points in the other novel to the fate of
a townsman, who, unlike the character in the former
book, is too full of the city virus for recovery. The
poison of the world has eaten right into him, and he
cannot escape his doom.</p>

<p>Rosegger can only compare town and country by the
strongest contrast of light and shade. And in the talks
which he collected in 1885 under the title of <cite>Mountain
Sermons, delivered in these latter days in the open air, and
dedicated to the reviling and derision of our Enemies, the
Weaknesses, the Vices and the Errors of Civilisation</cite>,
a fanatical anger is occasionally apparent: one misses
the beatitudes which the title leads one to expect.</p>

<p>And yet love is the gospel which Rosegger proclaims
at all times, and religious questions pervade his writings
from first to last. He is himself, like the chief character
in his book, a God-seeker. "Man creates for himself an
ideal, an always nobler image of himself, calls it God
and strives after it. So he climbs as if on a rope ladder,
throwing the upper end higher and higher up the rugged
wall of rocks towards the heaven of perfection. But who
taught him to do this? Surely He who has put the power
and spirit of growth in His creature's heart, God the
Father, who from everlasting created the world and will
create it to everlasting."</p>

<p>These conceptions are not exactly canonical, and it
has been Rosegger's experience to have an article of his,
<cite>How I picture to myself the personality of Christ</cite>, confiscated
by the licensing authorities as blasphemous.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
This induced him twice afterwards openly to state his
convictions; once in <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Mein Himmelreich</cite> (<cite>My Kingdom of
Heaven</cite>, 1900), and again in <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">I.N.R.I: Frohe Botschaft
eines armen Sünders</cite> (<cite>The Gospel of a poor Sinner</cite>, 1904).
These much-discussed writings give us an image of Christ
as Rosegger made it, putting it together from the four
gospels: a Christ rejoicing in God, intimate with man's
heart, filled with joy of the earth, with mighty creative
energy, with consuming wrath in due season; the Superman,
the God-man in the highest sense.</p>

<p>Rosegger is as strongly opposed to all the violent
"Missions" movements in the Church as to the faith-destroying
tendency of the modern world's point of view.
He holds piously by many an old belief, not because it
is for him an article of faith, but because it is a piece
of poetic childhood's remembrance; and he has saved
many a dogma for himself by interpreting it symbolically
and not literally. To the most poetic of his interpretations
belongs that of the Cross: "The Cross has a foot
rooted in Earth; that means 'Man, make use of the
Earth.' The Cross has a head that towers up into the
air of heaven; that means 'Man, remember thy ideals.'
The Cross has two arms stretching out to right and left,
not to chastise men, but to embrace all the world; that
means 'Man, love thy brothers.' Love, Joy,&mdash;those are
the two beams of our Cross. The world is not here as a
penance, but a joy." In such sentences as these is contained
Rosegger's whole Gospel of Joy, which looks for
its fulfilment on this side. For him the highest aim of
civilisation, as of religion, is the happiness of mankind.</p>

<p>This brings us to a conclusion. We have now seen
Rosegger develop from peasant to craftsman, to teacher,
to preacher. And now another question arises: Has
he not possibly reached a greater height still&mdash;is he a
prophet? Of that only late generations may judge; to
them it is given to see whether the new birth of mankind,
which Rosegger, like Tolstoy, looks for from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
return to the simplicities of life on the land, will be realised.
With Rosegger's prophecy, which we shall do well
to consider, I close this paper. "The future generations
will find peace and happiness again when they turn back
to Nature and give themselves up to the healthy influences
of the life of the soil. As yet, when the leaves
turn yellow, the townsfolk hurry back into their walls;
but there will come a time when the well-to-do citizens
will buy land and farm it themselves like peasants, and
when artisans will clear and reclaim such land from the
wilderness itself. They will renounce hyper-intellectualism,
and find pleasure and new vigour in bodily toil;
and they will make laws under which a firm-rooted and
honourable peasantry can once more thrive."</p>

My Father and I</h2>


<p class="cap2"><span class="upper">On</span> the whole I had not a bad bringing up, rather I
had none at all. When I was a good, devout,
obedient, apt child, my parents praised me; when I
was the reverse they gave me a downright scolding.
Praise almost always did me good and made me feel
inches taller; for some children like plants shoot up
only in sunshine.</p>

<p>But my father was of opinion that I ought not to
grow in height only, but also in breadth, and that to
this end reserve and austerity were good.</p>

<p>My mother was love itself. My father may have been
the same by nature, but he did not know how to express
his warm and loving heart. With all his gentleness this
care and labour-laden man had a taciturn, serious bearing:
only later, when he judged me man enough to
appreciate it, did he ever give his rich humour free play
before me.</p>

<p>During those years when I was tearing my first dozen
pairs of breeches, he concerned himself with me but
little except when I had done something naughty;
then he allowed his severity full play. His harshness
and my punishment generally consisted in his standing
over me, and in loud angry tones, holding up my sin
before me and pointing out the punishment I deserved.</p>

<p>When such an outburst occurred, it was my habit to
plant myself in front of my father and remain standing
before him as if petrified, with my arms hanging down,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
and looking steadily in his angry face throughout the
vehement rebuke. In my inmost heart I always repented
my wrongdoing and had the clearest sense of
guilt; but I also remember another feeling that used
to come over me during those homilies: a strange
trembling, a sense of charm and ecstasy when the storm
burst over my head. Tears came to my eyes and
trickled down my cheeks; but I stood rooted there
like a little tree, gazing up at my father, and was filled
with an inexplicable sense of wellbeing, that increased
mightily the longer and louder he thundered.</p>

<p>When after such a scene weeks went by without my
concocting mischief, and my father, kind and silent as
ever, went about his business without taking notice of
me, the longing to devise something to put him in a
rage gradually began and ripened in me again. This was
not for the sake of vexing him, for I loved him passionately;
nor yet from malice; but from another cause
which I did not understand at the time.</p>

<p>Thus it once happened on the sacred eve of Christmas.
In the previous summer in Maria Zell<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2" href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> my father had
bought a little black cross on which hung a Christus in
cast lead, and all the instruments of the Passion in the
same material. This treasure had been put safely away
until Christmas Eve, when my father brought it out
of his press and set it on the little house-altar. I profited
by the time when my parents and the rest of our people
were still busy on the farm outside and in the kitchen
making ready for the great festival, and, not without
endangering my sound limbs, I reached the crucifix
down from the wall, and crouched down behind the
stove with it, and began taking it to pieces. It was a
rare joy to me when with the aid of my little pocket-knife
I loosened first the ladder, then the pincers and
hammer, then Peter's cock, and at last the dear Christ
Himself from the cross. The separated parts seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
me much more interesting now than before as a whole;
but when I had finished and wanted to put the things
together again and could not, I began to grow hot inside
and thought I was choking. Would it stop at a mere
scolding this time? To be sure, I told myself: the black
cross is now much finer than before; there is a black
cross with nothing on it in the chapel in Hohenwang
too, and people go there to pray. Besides, who wants
a crucified Lord at Christmas time? At that time He
ought to be lying in the manger&mdash;the Priest said so; and
I must see about that now.</p>

<p>I bent the legs of the leaden Christus back and the
arms over the breast, then laid Him reverently in my
mother's work-basket, and so set my crib upon the house-altar;
while I hid the cross in the straw of my parents'
bed&mdash;forgetting that the basket would betray the taking
down from the cross.</p>

<p>Fate swiftly overtook me. My mother was first to
observe how absurdly the work-basket had got up
among the Saints to-day!</p>

<p>"Who can have found the crucifix in his way up
there?" asked my father at the very same moment.</p>

<p>I was standing a little apart, and I felt like a creature
thirsting for strong wine to drink. But at the same time
a strange fear warned me to get still farther into the
background if possible.</p>

<p>My father approached me, asking almost humbly
if I did not know where the crucifix had got to? I
stood bolt upright before him and looked him in the
face. He repeated his question. I pointed towards the
bed-straw; tears came, but I believe there was no
quiver of my lips.</p>

<p>My father searched for and found it, and was not
angry, only surprised when he saw the mishandling of
the sacred relic. My craving for the strong bitter wine
grew apace. My father put the bare cross on the
table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>"I can see," he said, speaking with perfect calmness,
and he took his hat down from the nail, "I can see he'll
have to be thoroughly punished at last. When even the
Lord Christ Himself is not safe&mdash;&mdash;! Mind you stay in
the room, boy!" he bade me darkly, and then went out
to the door.</p>

<p>"Run after him and beg for pardon!" cried my
mother to me. "He's gone to cut a birch-rod."</p>

<p>I was as if welded to the floor. With horrible clearness
I saw what would befall me, but was quite incapable of
taking a single step in self-defence. My mother went
about her work; I stood alone in the darkening room,
the mutilated crucifix on the table before me. The least
sound scared me. Inside the old case of the Black Forest
clock standing there on the floor against the wall, the
weights rattled as the clock struck five. At last I heard
someone outside knocking the snow off his shoes; that
was my father's step. When he entered the room with
the birch-rod I had vanished.</p>

<p>He went into the kitchen and demanded in abrupt and
angry tones where the rascal was? Then began a search
throughout the whole house; in the living-room the bed
and the corner by the stove and the great coffer were rummaged
through. I heard them moving about in the next
room, in the loft overhead. I heard orders given to search
through the very mangers in the byres and the hay and
straw in the barns; they were to go out to the shed, too,
and bring the fellow straight to his father&mdash;he should remember
this Christmas Eve all the rest of his life! But
they came back empty-handed. Two farm-hands were
to be sent about among the neighbours; but my
mother called out that if I had gone over the open
and through the forest to a neighbour I should certainly
be frozen to death, for my little coat and hat
were still in the room. What grief and vexation children
were!</p>

<p>They went away, the house was nearly empty and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the dark room there was nothing visible but the grey
squares of the windows. I was hidden in the clock-case
and could peep through the chinks. I had
squeezed in through the little door meant for winding
up the works and let myself down inside the panelling,
so that I was now standing upright in the clock-case.</p>

<p>What anguish I suffered in my hiding-place! That
no good could come of it all, and that the hourly increasing
commotion was certainly working towards an
hourly more dangerous conclusion, I clearly perceived.
I bitterly blamed the work-basket which had betrayed
me from the very beginning, and I blamed the little
crucifix; but I quite forgot to blame my own folly.
Hours passed, I was still in my up-on-end coffin,
already the icicles of the clock-weights touched the
crown of my head, and I had to duck myself down as
well as I could lest the stopping of the clock should lead
to its winding up and thereby the discovery of myself.
For my parents had at last come back into the room again
and kindled a light and were beginning to quarrel about
me.</p>

<p>"I don't know anywhere else to look for him," said
my father, and he sank exhausted on a chair.</p>

<p>"Just think, if he's gone astray in the forest, or if
he's lying under the snow!" cried my mother, and
broke into audible weeping.</p>

<p>"Don't say such things!" said my father, "I can't
bear to hear it."</p>

<p>"You can't bear to hear it, and yet you yourself have
driven him away with your harshness!"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't have broken any bones with these twigs,"
he replied, and brought the birch-rod swishing down
upon the table: "but if I catch him now, I'll break a
hedge-pole across his back!"</p>

<p>"Do it, do it!&mdash;perhaps it will never hurt him any
more!" said my mother, and wept again. "Do you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
think that children were given you only to vent your
anger on? In that case our dear Lord is quite right
when He takes them again betimes to Himself. One
must love little children if they're to come to any
good!"</p>

<p>Thereupon he said, "Who says that I don't love
the boy? I love him with my whole heart, God knows,
but I don't care to tell him so: I don't care to, and
what's more I can't. It doesn't hurt him half as much
as me when I have to punish him, that I <em>know</em>!"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm going out for another look!" sighed my
mother.</p>

<p>"I can't rest here, neither!" he said.</p>

<p>"You must just swallow a spoonful of warm soup, to
please me&mdash;it's supper-time," she said.</p>

<p>"I couldn't eat now, I'm fairly at my wits' end,"
said my father, and knelt down by the table and began
to pray silently.</p>

<p>My mother went into the kitchen to get together my
warm clothes for the fresh search in case they should
find me anywhere, half frozen. The room was silent
again, and I, in the clock-case, felt as if my heart must
burst for sorrow and anguish. Suddenly, in the midst of
his prayer, my father began to sob convulsively. His
head fell on his arm and his whole body shook.</p>

<p>I gave a piercing cry.</p>

<p>A few seconds later I was lifted out of my shell
by my parents, and I fell at my father's feet and clung
whimpering to his knee.</p>

<p>"Father, father!" were the only words I could
stammer out. He reached down to me with both his
arms, lifted me up to his breast, and my hair was wet
with his tears.</p>

<p>In that moment the eyes of my understanding were
opened.</p>

<p>I saw how dreadful it was to anger and offend such a
father. But I saw, too, why I had done so&mdash;from sheer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
longing to see my father's face before me, to be able to
look into his eyes and hear his voice speaking to <em>me</em>.
If he could not be cheery as others were with me, and
as he, at that time so care-laden, seldom was, then I
would at least look into his angry eyes, hear his harsh
words. They went tingling deliciously all through me,
and drew me to him with irresistible might. At least
they were my father's eyes and words.</p>

<p>No further jar unhallowed our Christmas Eve, and
from that day on things were very different. My father
had become deeply aware of his love for me and my
devotion to him; and, in many an hour of play, work,
and rest, bestowed upon me his dear face and kindly
conversation, so that I never again needed to get them
by guile.</p>

How I Gave God My
Sunday Jacket</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> church of the Alpine village of Ratten contains a
nearly life-size equestrian statue, standing to the
left of the high altar. The horseman is a splendid
warrior; he wears a crested helmet and moustaches
black as ebony. He has drawn his broad and gleaming
sword and is using it to cut his cloak in half. At the foot
of the prancing steed cowers the figure of a ragged
beggar-man.</p>

<p>My mother used to take me to this church when I was
still a little whipper-snapper, hardly up to the height of
an ordinary person's trousers. Near the church stands
a lady-chapel, famed for its many graces; and here my
mother loved to pray. Often, when there was not another
soul remaining in the chapel and twelve o'clock struck
and the steeple sent the midday Angelus clanging out
across the summer Sunday, mother would still be kneeling
on one of the chairs and sending up her plaint to Mary.
The Blessed Virgin sat on the altar, with her hand in her
lap, and moved not head, nor eyes, nor hands; and so,
little by little, my mother was able to say what she
wanted.</p>

<p>I preferred to stop in the church and gaze at the fine
rider on his horse.</p>

<p>And once, when we were on our way home and mother
leading me by the hand (and I had always to take three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
steps for every one of hers), I raised my little head to her
kind face and asked:</p>

<p>"Why does the man on horseback keep on standing
against the wall up there? Why does he not ride out
through the window into the street?"</p>

<p>Then mother answered:</p>

<p>"Because you put such childish questions and because
it is only a statue, the statue of St. Martin, who was a
soldier and a very charitable and pious man and is now in
Heaven."</p>

<p>"And is the horse in Heaven too?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I will tell you all about St. Martin," said mother,
"when we come to a nice place where we can sit down
and rest."</p>

<p>And she led me on and I skipped along beside her. But
I was very anxious for the resting-place and constantly
cried out:</p>

<p>"Mother, here's a nice place!"</p>

<p>But she was not content until we came to the shady
wood, where a flat, mossy stone stood; and then we sat
down. Mother fastened her kerchief tighter round her
head and was silent, as though she had forgotten her
promise. I stared and stared at her lips and then peeped
through the trees; and once or twice it appeared to me
as though I had seen the grand horseman riding through
the wood.</p>

<p>"Yes, true enough, laddie," mother began, suddenly,
"we must always help the poor, for the love of God. But
you won't find many fine gentlemen like St. Martin
nowadays, trotting about on their tall horses. You know
how the icy blast rushes over our sheep-walk, when
winter is nigh&mdash;your own little paws were nearly frozen
there last year! Well, it was just such a stretch of heath
that St. Martin came riding over one evening late in
autumn. The earth is frozen hard as stone; and it makes
a fine noise each time the horse puts hoof to ground. The
snowflakes dance all round about; not one of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
melts away. Night is just beginning to fall; and the
horse clatters over the heath and the rider draws his white
cloak round him as close as ever he can. Well, as he
rides on like that, suddenly he sees a little beggar-man
squatting on a stone, with nothing to cover him but a
torn jacket; and he shivering with cold and lifting his
sad eyes to the tall horse. Whoa! When the horseman
sees that, he pulls up his steed and bends over and says to
the beggar, 'Oh, my dear, poor man, what alms can I give
you? Gold and silver I have none; and my sword you
could never use. How can I help you?' Then the beggar
lets his white head fall on his half-naked breast and heaves
a sigh. But the horseman draws his sword, takes his
cloak from his shoulders and cuts it across the middle.
One half of the garment he hands down to the poor
shivering grey-beard: 'Take this, my needy brother!'
he says. The other half of the cloak he flings round his
own body, as best he can, and rides away."</p>

<p>This was the story my mother told me; and, with those
cold autumn evenings of hers, she made that lovely
midsummer day feel so chilly that I shivered.</p>

<p>"But it's not quite finished yet, my child," mother
continued. "You know now what the horseman with the
beggar in the church means; but you have not heard
what happened afterwards. When the rider, later on at
night, lies sleeping peacefully on his hard bolster at home,
the same beggar whom he met on the heath comes to his
bedside, smiles and shows him the half cloak, shows him
the marks of the nails in His hands and shows him His
face, which is no longer old and sorrowful, but radiant as
the sun. This same beggar from the heath was Our Lord
Himself.&mdash;There, laddie, and now we must be getting
on."</p>

<p>Then we stood up and climbed into the woods on the
mountain-side.</p>

<p>On the way home, we met two beggar-men; I peered
very closely into their faces; for I thought:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>"Our Lord may be concealed behind one of them."</p>

<p>On the evening of the same day, I was told to take off
my Sunday suit&mdash;for father was a thrifty man&mdash;and was
playing and skipping about in my shabby workaday
breeches, with only the brand-new grey jacket, which I
did not want to take off and had begged to be allowed to
wear for the rest of the day. Mother was attending to
her household duties and I ran out to the sheep-walk,
for it was my business to bring the sheep home to the
fold, including a little white lamb that was my own
property.</p>

<p>As I hopped along, throwing stones into the air and
trying to hit the golden evening clouds, suddenly I saw an
old, white-headed and very poorly dressed man squatting
on a rock a little way off. I stopped, greatly startled;
dared not take another step; and thought to myself:</p>

<p>"Now this is most certainly Our Lord."</p>

<p>I trembled with fear and joy and simply had no notion
what to do.</p>

<p>"If it <em>is</em> Our Lord," I said to myself, "then surely I
must give Him something. If I go home now, so that
mother comes and looks out and sees me and tells me how
the matter stands, He might be gone in the meantime; and
that would be disgraceful and ridiculous. I think it is He
beyond a doubt: the one whom the horseman met looked
just like that."</p>

<p>I went a few steps back and began to tear at my grey
jacket. It was no easy work: the coat fitted so tightly
over my coarse linen shirt; and I did not want to be
puffing and panting, lest the beggar-man should notice
me too soon. I had a yellow-handled pocket-knife, brand-new
and just lately sharpened. I took it out of my
pocket, put the little coat under my knee and began to
divide it down the middle.</p>

<p>It was soon done and I stole up to the beggar-man, who
seemed to be half asleep, and put his part of my coat on
his head:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>"Take this, my needy brother!" I said, silently, in
my thoughts.</p>

<p>Then I put my half of the coat under my arm, gazed at
Our Lord a little longer and then drove the sheep from
the walk.</p>

<p>"He is sure to come in the night," I thought, "and
then father and mother will see Him and, if He wishes to
stop with us, we can fit up the back room and the little
altar for Him."</p>

<p>I lay in the cupboard-bedstead, beside father and
mother, and I could not sleep. The night passed and He
Whom I was expecting did not come.</p>

<p>But, early in the morning, when the barn-door cock
crowed the men and maids out of their beds and when the
noisy working-day began in the yard outside, an old man&mdash;he
was nicknamed Mushroom Moses&mdash;came to my
father, brought him the piece of my jacket which I had
given away and told how I had wantonly cut it the
evening before and flung one half at his head as he was
taking a rest on the sheep-walk after hunting for mushrooms.</p>

<p>Thereupon my father came up softly to my bed, with
one hand hidden behind his back.</p>

<p>"Look here, lad, just you tell me what you've done
with your new Sunday jacket!"</p>

<p>That soft slinking with his hand behind his back at once
struck me as suspicious; and my face fell; and, bursting
into tears, I cried:</p>

<p>"Oh, father, I thought I was giving it to God!"</p>

<p>"Lord, lad, what a duffer&mdash;what an idiot you are!"
cried my father. "You're much too good for this world
and yet quite too silly to die! What you want is to
have your soul thrashed out of your skin with a stout
besom."</p>

<p>And then, when the hand with the twisted birch-rod
came in view, I raised a great hullabaloo.</p>

<p>Mother came rushing up at once. As a rule, she seldom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
interfered when father was correcting me; but, this time,
she caught hold of his hand and said:</p>

<p>"I dare say I can sew the jacket together again, father.
Come with me: I have something to tell you."</p>

<p>They both went out into the kitchen; I think they
must have discussed the story of St. Martin. Presently,
they came back to the room.</p>

<p>Father said:</p>

<p>"All right now, be quiet; there's nothing going to be
done to you."</p>

<p>And mother whispered in my ear:</p>

<p>"It's all right, your wanting to give your jacket to
Our Lord; but it'll be better still if we give it to the poor
boy down in the valley. Our Lord lies hidden in every
poor man. St. Martin knew that too, you see. So there.
And now, lad, jump out of bed and get your breeches on;
father's not so very far off yet with that birch of his!"</p>

Christmas Eve</h2>


<p class="cap2"><span class="upper">Year</span> in, year out, there stood by the grey clay-plastered
wall of the stove in our living-room an
oaken footstool. It was always smooth and clean, for,
like the other furniture, it was rubbed every Saturday
with fine river sand and a wisp of straw. In spring,
summer, and autumn-time this stool stood empty and
lonely in its corner, save when of an evening my grandmother
pulled it a little forward to kneel on it and say
her evening prayer. On Saturdays, too, while my father
said the prayers for the end of the week, grandmother
knelt upon the stool.</p>

<p>But when during the long evenings in late autumn the
farm-hands were cutting small household torches from
the resinous logs, and the maids, along with my mother
and grandmother, spinning wool and flax, and all during
Advent time, when old fairy tales were told and hymns
were sung&mdash;then I always sat on the stool by the stove.</p>

<p>From out my corner I listened to the stories and songs,
and if they became creepy and my little soul began to be
moved with terror, I shoved the stool nearer to my mother
and covertly held on by her dress; and could not possibly
understand how the others still dared to laugh at me, or
at the terrible stories. At last when bedtime came, and
my mother pulled my little box-bed out for me, I simply
could not go to bed alone, and my grandmother must
lie beside me until the frightful visions had faded and
I fell asleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>But with us the long Advent nights were always short.
Soon after two o'clock, the house began to grow restless.
In the attics above one could hear the farm-lads
dressing and moving about, and in the kitchen the maids
broke up kindling wood and poked the fire. Then they
all went out to the threshing floor to thresh.</p>

<p>My mother was also up and about, and had kindled a
light in the living-room; soon after that my father rose,
and they both put on somewhat better clothes than they
wore on working-days and yet not their Sunday best.
Then mother said a few words to grandmother, who still
lay a-bed, and when I, wakened by the stir, made some
sort of remark, she only answered, "You lie nice and
quiet and go to sleep again!" Then my parents lighted
a lantern, extinguished the light in the room, and left the
house. I heard the outer door close, and saw the gleam
of light go glimmering past the window, and I heard
the crunching of footsteps in the snow and the rattling
of the house-dog's chain. Then, save for the regular
throb of the threshers at work, all was once more quiet
and I fell asleep again.</p>

<p>My father and mother were going to the Rorate<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3" href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> at
the parish church, nearly three hours away. I followed
them in my dream. I could hear the church bell, and
the sound of the organ and the Advent song, "Hail
Mary, thou bright morning star!" I saw, too, the lights
on the high altar; and the little angels that stood above
it spread out their golden wings and flew about the church,
and the one with the trumpet, standing over the pulpit,
passed out over the heath and into the forests and blew
throughout the whole world that the coming of the
Saviour was near at hand.</p>

<p>When I awoke the sun had long been shining into the
windows; outside the snow glittered and shimmered,
and indoors my mother went about again in workaday
clothes and did her household tasks. Grandmother's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
bed, next mine, was already made, and she herself now
came in from the kitchen and helped me to put on my
breeches, and washed my face with cold water, that
stung me so that I was ready to laugh and cry at the same
moment. That over I knelt on my stool and prayed with
grandmother the morning prayer:</p>

</div>

<p>After these devotions I received my morning soup,
and then came grandmother with a tub full of turnips
which we were to peel together. I sat close beside it on
my stool. But in the matter of peeling turnips I could
never quite satisfy grandmother: I constantly cut the
rind too thick, or here and there even left it whole upon
the turnip. When, moreover, I cut my finger and instantly
began to cry, my grandmother said, very crossly,
"You're a regular nuisance, it would be a good thing to
pitch you right out into the snow!" All the while she
was binding up my wound with unspeakable love and
care.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>So passed the Advent season, and grandmother and
I talked more and more often about Christmas Eve
and of the Christchild who would so soon be coming
among men.</p>

<p>The nearer we came to the festival the greater the
stir in the house. The men turned the cattle out of the
stall and put fresh straw there and set the mangers and
barriers in good order; the cowman rubbed the oxen till
they looked quite smooth; the stockman mixed more
hay than usual in the straw and prepared a great heap of
it in the hayloft. The milkmaid did the same. Threshing
had already ceased some days ago, because, according
to our belief, the noise would have profaned the approaching
Holy Day.</p>

<p>Through all the house there was washing and
scrubbing; even into the living-room itself came the
maids with their water-pails and straw wisps and brooms.
I always looked forward to the cleaning, because I loved
the turning topsy-turvy of everything, and because the
glazed pictures in the corner where the table was, the
brown clock from the Black Forest with its metal bell,
and the various things which, at other times, I saw only
at a distance high above me, were taken down and
brought nearer to me, and I could observe them all
much more closely and from all sides. To be sure, I was
not allowed to handle such things, because I was still too
clumsy and careless for that and might easily damage
them. But there were moments in that eager scrubbing
and rubbing when people did not notice me.</p>

<p>In one such moment I climbed from the stool to the
bench, and from the bench to the table, which was pushed
out of its place and on which lay the Black Forest clock.
I made for the clock, whose weights hung over the edge of
the table, looked through an open side-door into the very
dusty brass works, tapped several times on the little
cogs of the winding-wheel, and at last even laid my
finger on the wheel itself to see if it would go; but it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
didn't. Eventually I gently pushed a small stick of wood,
and as I did so the works began to rattle frightfully.
Some of the wheels went slowly, others quicker, and the
winding-wheel flew round so fast that one could hardly
see it at all. I was indescribably frightened, and rolled
from the table over bench and stool down on to the wet,
dirty floor; then my mother gripped me by my little
coat&mdash;and there, sure enough, was the birch-rod!<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5" href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The
whirring inside the clock would not leave off, and finally
my mother laid hold of me with both hands, carried me
into the entrance, pushed me through the door and out
into the snow, and shut the door behind me. There
I stood like one undone; I could hear my mother&mdash;whom
I must have offended badly&mdash;still scolding within
doors, and the laughing and scrubbing of the maids, and
through it all the whirring of the clock.</p>

<p>When I had stood there sobbing for a while and still
nobody came to call me back into the house, I set off
for the path that was trodden in the snow, and I went
through the home meadow and across the open land
towards the forest. I did not know whither I would go,
I only conceived that a great wrong had been done me
and that I could never go home again.</p>

<p>But I had not reached the forest when I heard a shrill
whistle behind me. That was the whistle my grandmother
made when she put two fingers in her mouth,
pointed her tongue, and blew. "Where are you going,
you stupid child?" she cried. "Take care; if you run
about in the forest like that, Moss-Maggie will catch
you! Look out!"</p>

<p>At this word I instantly turned round, for I feared
Moss-Maggie unspeakably. But I did not go home
yet. I hung about in the farmyard, where my father
and two of our men had just killed a pig. Watching
them I forgot what had happened to myself, and when
my father set about skinning it in the outhouse I stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
by holding the ends of the skin, which with his big knife
he gradually detached from the carcase. When later
on the intestines had been taken out and my mother was
pouring water into the basin, she said to me, "Run away
or you'll get splashed."</p>

<p>From the way in which she spoke I could tell that my
mother was once more reconciled with me and all was
right again; and when I went into the dwelling-room
to warm myself a bit, everything was back in its own
place. Floor and walls were still moist, but scrubbed
clean, and the Black Forest clock was once more hanging
on the wall and ticking. And it ticked much louder and
clearer than before through the freshly ordered room.</p>

<p>At last the washing and scrubbing and polishing came
to an end, the house grew peacefuller, almost silent, and
the Sacred Vigil was upon us. On Christmas Eve we used
not to have our dinner in the living-room, but in the
kitchen, where we made the large pastry-board our table,
and sat round it and ate the simple fasting fare silently,
but with uplifted hearts.</p>

<p>The table in the dwelling-room was covered with a
snow-white cloth, and beside it stood my stool, upon
which, when the twilight fell, my grandmother knelt and
prayed silently.</p>

<p>The maids went quietly about the house and got their
holiday clothes ready, and mother put pieces of meat in
a big pot and poured water on them and set it on the open
fire. I stole softly about the room on tiptoe and heard
only the jolly crackling of the kitchen fire. I gazed
at my Sunday breeches and coat and the little black felt
hat which were ready hanging on a nail in the wall, and
then I looked through the window out at the oncoming
dusk. If no rough weather set in I was to be allowed
to go with the head farm-servant, Sepp, to the midnight
Mass. And the weather was quiet, and moreover,
according to my father, it was not going to be very cold,
because the mist lay upon the hills.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>Just before the "censing," in which, following ancient
custom, house and farm were blessed with holy water
and incense, my father and my mother fell out a little.
Maggie the Moss-gatherer had been there to wish us
all a blessed Christmastide, and my mother had presented
her with a piece of meat for the feast-day. My
father was somewhat vexed at this; in other ways, he
was a good friend to the poor, and not seldom gave them
more than we could well spare; but in his opinion one
ought not to give Moss-Maggie any alms whatever.
The Moss-gatherer was a woman not belonging to our
neighbourhood, who went wandering around in the
forests without permission, collecting moss and roots,
making fires and sleeping in the half-ruined huts of
charcoal-burners. Besides that, she went begging to the
farmhouses, offering moss for sale, and if she did but
poor business there she wept and railed at her life.
Children at whom she looked were sore terrified, and
many even became ill; and she could make cows give
red milk. Whoever showed her kindness, she would
follow for several minutes, saying, "May God reward
you a thousand and a thousandfold right up into heaven!"
But to anyone who mocked, or in any other way whatsoever
offended her, she said, "I pray you down into the
nethermost hell!"</p>

<p>Moss-Maggie often came to us, and she loved to sit
before the house on the grass, or on the stile over the
hedge, in spite of the loud barking and chain-clanking
of our house-dog, who showed singular violence towards
this woman. She would remain there until my mother
took her out a cup of milk or a bit of bread. My mother
was glad when Moss-Maggie thereupon gave her a
thousandfold-right-up-to-heaven-may-God-reward-you;
but my father considered the wish of this person worthless,
whether as curse or blessing.</p>

<p>Some years earlier, when they were building the school-house
in the village, this woman had come to the place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
with her husband and helped at the work, until one
day the man was killed at stone-blasting. Since then she
had worked no more, nor did she go away; but she just
idled about, nobody knowing what she did nor what she
wanted. She could never again be persuaded to do any
work&mdash;she seemed to be crazed.</p>

<p>The magistrate had several times sent Moss-Maggie
out of the district, but she always returned. "She
wouldn't always be coming back," said my father,
"if she got nothing by begging in the neighbourhood.
As it is she'll just stay about here, and when she's old and
ill, we shall have to nurse her as well: it's a cross that
we ourselves have tied round our necks."</p>

<p>My mother said nothing in reply to such words, but
when Moss-Maggie came she still gave the usual alms,
and to-day in honour of the great feast a little more.</p>

<p>Hence then arose the little dispute between my father
and mother, which however was at once silenced when
two farm-hands bearing the incense and holy water
entered the house. After the censing my father placed
a lighted candle on the table; to-day pine-splinters
might only be burned in the kitchen. Supper was once
again eaten in the living-room. During supper the head
farm-servant told us all manner of wonderful stories.</p>

<p>When we had finished my mother sang a shepherd's
song. Rapturously as I listened to these songs at other
times, to-day I could think of nothing but the churchgoing,
and longed above everything to get at once into
my Sunday clothes. They assured me there would be
time enough for that later on; but at last my grandmother
yielded to my urgent appeal and dressed me.
The cowman dressed himself very carefully in his festal
finery, because he was not going home after the midnight
mass, but would stay in the village till morning.
About nine o'clock the other farm-servants and the maids
were also ready, and they kindled a torch at the candle
flame. I held on to Sepp, the head servant; and my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
parents and grandmother, who stayed at home to take
care of the house, sprinkled me with holy water that
I might neither fall nor freeze to death. Then we
started off.</p>

<p>It was very dark, and the torch, borne before us by the
cowman, threw its red light in a great disk on the snow,
and the hedge, the stone-heaps and the trees past which
we went. This red illumination, which was broken
too by the great shadows of our bodies, seemed very
awful to me, and I clung fearfully to Sepp, until he remarked,
"Look here, leave me my coat; what should
I do if you tore it off my back?"</p>

<p>For a time the path was very narrow, so that we had
to go one behind the other, and I was only thankful
that I was not the last, for I imagined that he for certain
must be exposed to endless dangers from ghosts.</p>

<p>There was a cutting wind and the glowing splinters of
the torch flew far afield, and even when they fell on the
hard snow-crust they still glowed for a while.</p>

<p>So far we had gone across open ground and down
through thickets and forest; now we came to a brook
which I knew well&mdash;it flowed through the meadow where
we made hay in summer. Then the brook had been noisy
enough; to-day one could only hear it murmur and
gurgle, for it was frozen over. We passed along by a mill
where I was badly scared because some sparks flew on
to the roof; but there was snow lying upon it and the
sparks were quenched. When we had gone some way
along the valley, we left the brook and the way led upwards
through a dark wood where the snow lay very
shallow but had no such firm surface as out in the open.</p>

<p>At last we came to a wide road, where we could walk
side by side, and now and again we heard sleigh-bells.
The torch had already burned right down to the cowman's
hand, and he kindled another that he had with him.
On the road were visible several other lights&mdash;great red
torches that came flaring towards us as if they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
swimming in the black air, behind which first one and
then several more faces of the churchgoers gradually
emerged, who now joined company with us. And we
saw lights on other hills and heights, that were still
so far off we could not be sure whether they were still
or moving.</p>

<p>So we went on. The snow crunched under our feet,
and wherever the wind had carried it away, there the
black patch of bare ground was so hard that our shoes
rang upon it. The people talked and laughed a great
deal, but this seemed not a bit right to me in the holy
night of Christmas. I could only think all the while about
the church and what it must be like when there is music
and High Mass in the dead of night.</p>

<p>When we had been going for a long time along the
road and past isolated trees and houses, then again over
fields and through a wood, I suddenly heard a faint ringing
in the tree-tops. When I wanted to listen, I couldn't
hear it; but soon after I heard it again, and clearer than
the first time. It was the sound of the little bell in the
church steeple. The lights which we saw on the hills and
in the valley became more and more frequent, and we
could now see that they were all hastening churchwards.</p>

<p>The little calm stars of the lanterns floated towards
us, and the road was growing livelier all the time. The
small bell was relieved by a greater, and this one went
on ringing until we had almost reached the church. So
it was true, what grandmother had said: at midnight
the bells begin to ring, and they ring until the very
last dweller in the farthest valleys has come to
church.</p>

<p>The church stands on a hill covered with birches and
firs, and round it lies the little God's-acre encircled by a
low wall. The few houses of the village are down in the
valley.</p>

<p>When the people came close to the church, they extinguished
their torches by sticking them head downwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
in the snow. Only one was fixed between two
stones in the churchyard wall, and left burning.</p>

<p>And now from the steeple in slow, rhythmical swing,
rang out the great bell. A clear light shone through the
high, narrow windows. I longed to go into the church;
but Sepp said there was still plenty of time, and stayed
where he was, laughing and talking with other young
fellows and filling himself a pipe.</p>

<p>At last all the bells pealed out together; the organ
began to play inside the church, and then we all went in.
There it looked quite different from what it did on Sundays.
The candles burning on the altar were clear, white,
beaming stars, and the gilded tabernacle reflected them
most gloriously. The lamp of the sanctuary light was
red. The upper part of the church was so dark that one
could not see the beautiful painting of the nave. Mysterious
shapes of men were seated in the chairs, or standing
beside them; the women were much wrapped up in
shawls and were coughing. Many had candles burning
in front of them, and they sang out of their books when
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Te Deum</i> rang out from the chancel.</p>

<p>Sepp led me between two rows of chairs towards a
side altar, where several people were standing. There
he lifted me up on to a stool before a glass case, which,
lighted by two candles, was placed between two branches
of fir trees, and which I had never seen before when I
went to church with my parents. When Sepp had set
me on the stool, he said softly in my ear, "There, now
you can have a look at the crib." Then he left me standing,
and I gazed in through the glass. Thereupon came
a friendly little woman and whispered, "Look here,
child, if you want to see that, somebody ought to explain
it to you." And she told me who the little figures were.
I looked at them. Save for the Mother Mary, who had
a blue wrapped garment round her head which fell down
to her very feet, all the figures represented mere human
beings: the men were dressed just like our farm-servants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
or the elder peasants. Even St. Joseph wore green
stockings and short chamois-leather breeches.</p>

<p>When the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Te Deum</i> was over, Sepp came back, lifted
me from the stool, and we sat down on a bench. Then
the sacristan went round lighting all the candles that
were in the church, and every man, including Sepp, pulled
a little candle out of his pouch, lighted it, and fastened it
on to the desk in front of him. Now it was so bright in
the church that one could see the paintings on the roof
clearly enough.</p>

<p>Up in the choir they were tuning fiddles and trumpets
and drums, and, just as the little bell on the door of the
sacristy rang, and the priest in his glittering vestments,
accompanied by acolytes and tall lantern-bearers, passed
over the crimson carpet to the altar, the organ burst
forth in all its strength, joined by a blast of trumpets and
roll of drums.</p>

<p>The incense smoke was rising, and shrouding the
shining high altar in a veil. Thus the High Mass began,
and thus it shone and sounded and rang in the middle of
the night. Throughout the offertory all the instruments
were silent, only two clear voices sang a lovely shepherd-song;
and during the Benedictus a clarionet and two
horns slow and softly crooned the cradle-song. During
the Gospel and the Elevation we heard the cuckoo and
nightingale in the choir, just as in the midst of the sunny
spring-time.</p>

<p>Deep down in my soul I understood it, the wonder and
splendour of Christmas. But I did not exclaim with
delight; I remained grave and silent, I felt the solemn
glory of it all. But while the music was playing I could
not help thinking about father and mother and grandmother
at home. They are kneeling by the table now in
the light of the single candle, and praying; or they are
even asleep, and the room is all dark&mdash;only the clock ticking&mdash;while
a deep peace lies upon the forest-clad mountains,
and the Eve of Christmas is spread abroad over all the earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>The little candles in the seats were burning themselves
out, one after another, as the service neared its close
at last; and the sacristan went round again and extinguished
the lights on the walls and altars and before
the pictures with the little tin cap. Those on the high
altar were still burning when a joyous march music
sounded from the choir and the folk went crowding out of
the incense-laden church.</p>

<p>When we came outside, in spite of the thick mist which
had descended from the hills, it was no longer quite
so dark as before midnight. The moon must have risen;
no more torches were lighted. It struck one o'clock,
but the schoolmaster was already ringing the prayer bell
for Christmas morning.</p>

<p>I glanced once more at the church windows. All the
festal shine was quenched, I saw only the dull red glimmer
of the sanctuary lamp.</p>

<p>And now, when I wanted to renew my hold on Sepp's
coat, he was no longer there: I found myself among
strangers, who talked together for a little, and then immediately
set out for their several homes. My guide must
be already on ahead. I hurried after him, running quickly
past several people, hoping soon to overtake him. I ran
as hard as my little feet were able, going through a dark
wood and across fields over which such a keen wind was
blowing, that warm as I otherwise was I scarcely felt
my nose and ears at all. I passed houses and clumps of
trees; the people who were still on the road a short time
before had dropped off little by little; I was all alone,
and still I hadn't overtaken Sepp. I thought he might
just as well be still behind me, but I determined to hurry
straight home. Here and there I saw black spots on the
road, the charcoal that folk had shaken down from their
torches on their way to church. I made up my mind
not to look at the bushes and little trees which stood
beside the way and loomed eerily out of the mist, for they
scared me. I was specially frightened whenever a path<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
cut straight across the road, because that was a cross-road,
where on Christmas Eve the Evil One loves to
stand, and has chinking treasure with him with which he
entices the hapless children of men to himself. It is true
the cowman had said he did not believe it, but such
things must be or people would not talk so much about
them. I was very agitated; I turned my eyes in all
directions, lest a ghost should be somewhere making for
me. Then I determined to think no more of such nonsense;
but the harder I made up my mind, the more I
thought about it.</p>

<p>And now I had reached the path which should take
me down through the forest and into the valley. I turned
aside and ran along under the long-branched trees. Their
tops rustled loudly, and now and again a great lump of
snow fell down beside me. Sometimes it was so dark that
I did not see the trunks until I ran up against them; and
then I lost the path. This I did not mind very much, for
the snow was shallow and the ground nice and level.
But gradually it began to grow steep and steeper, and
there were a lot of brambles and heather under the snow.
The tree-stems were no longer spaced so regularly, but
were scattered about, many leaning all awry, many with
torn-up roots resting against others, and many, in a wild
confusion of up-reaching branches, lying prone upon the
ground. I did not remember seeing all this on our outward
journey. Sometimes I could hardly get on at all,
but had to wriggle in and out through the bushes and
branches. Often the snow-crust gave way under me, and
then the stiff heather reached right up to my chest. I
realised I had lost the right path, but told myself that
when I was once in the valley and beside the brook I
should follow that along and so was bound to come at
last to the mill and our own meadows.</p>

<p>Lumps of snow fell into the pockets of my coat, snow
clung to my little breeches and stockings, and the water
ran down into my shoes. At first all that clambering over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
fallen trees and creeping through undergrowth had tired
me, but now the weariness had vanished; I didn't heed
the snow, and I didn't heed the heather, nor the boughs
that so often scratched me roughly about the face, but
I just hurried on. I was constantly falling, but as
quickly picking myself up again. Then, too, all fear of
ghosts was gone; I thought of nothing but the valley
and our house. I had no notion how long I had been
astray in the wilderness, but felt strong and nimble, terror
spurring me on.</p>

<p>Suddenly I found myself standing on the brink of a
precipice. Down in the abyss a grey fog lay, with here
and there a tree-top rising out of it. The forest was
sparser about me, it was bright overhead and the half-moon
stood in the sky. Before me, and away beyond
that, there was nothing but strange cone-shaped, forest-clad
mountains.</p>

<p>Down there in the depths must be the valley and the
mill. It seemed to me as if I heard the murmur of the
brook; but it was only the soughing of the wind in
the forest on the farther side.</p>

<p>I went to right and to left, searching for a footpath
that might take me down, and I found a place where
I thought I should be able to lower myself by the help of
the loose rocks which lay about, and of the juniper
bushes. In this I succeeded for a little, but only just in
time I clutched hold of a root&mdash;I had nearly pitched over
a perpendicular cliff. After that I could go no farther,
but sank in sheer exhaustion to the ground. In the
depths below lay the fog with the black tree-tops. Save
for the soughing of the wind in the forest, I heard nothing.
I did not know where I was. If only a deer would come
I would ask my way of it; quite probably it would be
able to direct me, for everyone knows that on Christmas
Eve the beasts can talk like men.</p>

<p>I got up to climb back again, but only loosened the
rocks and made no progress. Hands and feet were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
aching. I stood still and called for Sepp as loud as ever
I could. Lingering and faint, my voice fell back from
the forests and cliffs. Then again I heard nothing but the
soughing of the wind.</p>

<p>The frost was cutting right into my limbs. "Sepp!
Sepp!" I shouted once more with all my might. Again
nothing but the long-drawn-out echo. Then a fearful
anguish took possession of me. I called quickly, one
after another, my parents, my grandmother, all the farm-hands
and maids of our household by name. It was all
in vain.</p>

<p>I began to cry miserably.</p>

<p>There I stood trembling, my body throwing a long
shadow aslant down the naked rock. I went to and fro
along the ledge to warm myself a little, and I prayed
aloud to the holy Christchild to save me.</p>

<p>The moon stood high in the dark heavens.</p>

<p>I could no longer cry or pray, I could scarcely move
any more. I crouched down shivering on a stone and
said to myself, "I shall go to sleep now; it's all only
a dream, and when I wake up I shall either be at home or
in heaven."</p>

<p>Then on a sudden I heard a rustling in the juniper
bushes above me, and soon after I felt that something
was touching me and lifting me up. I wanted to scream,
but I couldn't&mdash;my voice was frozen within me. Fear
and anguish kept my eyes fast shut. Hands and feet,
too, were as if lamed, I could not move them. Then I felt
warm, and it seemed to me as if all the mountain rocked
with me.</p>

<p>When I came to myself and awoke it was still night;
but I was standing at the door of my home and the house-dog
was barking furiously. Somebody had let me slip
down on the hard-trodden snow, and had then knocked
loudly on the door and hurried away. I had recognised
this somebody; it was the Moss-wife.</p>

<p>The door opened, and grandmother threw herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
upon me with the words, "Jesus Christ, here
he is!"</p>

<p>She carried me into the warm living-room, but from
thence quickly back again into the entrance. There she
set me on the bread-trough, and hastened outside and
blew her most piercing whistle.</p>

<p>She was quite alone. When Sepp had come back from
church and not found me at home, and when, too, the
others came and I was with none of them, they had all
gone down into the forest and through the valley and
up the other side to the high road, and in all directions.
Even my mother had gone with them, and everywhere,
all the time, had called out my name.</p>

<p>So soon as my grandmother believed it could no longer
harm me, she carried me back into the warm room, and
when she drew off my shoes and stockings they were
quite frozen together and almost frozen to my feet.
Thereupon she again hurried out of doors, whistled again,
brought some snow in a pail, and set me barefoot down in
it. Standing thus I felt such a violent pain in my toes
that I groaned; but grandmother said, "That's all
right; if it hurts, your feet aren't frozen."</p>

<p>Soon after that the red morning light shone in through
the window, and one by one all the farm-hands came
home. At length my father, and quite last of all&mdash;when
the red disk of the sun was rising over the Wechselalpe,
and after grandmother had whistled countless times&mdash;came
my mother. She came to my little bed, where they
had tucked me up, my father sitting beside me. She
was quite hoarse.</p>

<p>She said I ought to go to sleep now, and she covered
the window with a cloth so that the sun should not shine
in my face. But my father seemed to think I ought not
to go to sleep yet: he wanted to know how I had got
away from the servant without his noticing it, and where
I had been wandering. I at once related how I had lost
the path, and how I got into the wilderness; and when I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
had told them about the moon and the black forests, and
about the soughing of the wind and the rocky precipice,
my father said under his breath to my mother, "Wife,
let us give God praise and thanks that he is here&mdash;he
has been on the Troll's rock!"</p>

<p>At these words my mother gave me a kiss on the
cheek, a thing she did but seldom, and then she put her
apron before her face and went away.</p>

<p>"Well, you young scaramouch, and how did you get
home after all?" asked my father. I said I didn't
know; that after a prolonged sleeping and rocking, I
found myself at our door, and that Moss-Maggie had
stood beside me. My father asked me yet again about
this circumstance, but I told him I hadn't got anything
else to say about it.</p>

<p>My father then said he must be off to High Mass in
the church, because to-day was Christmas Day; and he
bade me go to sleep.</p>

<p>I must have slept many hours after that, for when I
awoke it was twilight outside, and in the dwelling-room
it was nearly dark. My grandmother sat nodding beside
my bed, and from the kitchen I heard the crackling of
the fire on the hearth.</p>

<p>Later, when the servants were all sitting at the evening
meal, Moss-Maggie was with them at table. During the
morning service she had been out in the churchyard,
cowering on her husband's grave; and after High Mass
my father went and found her there and brought her
with him to our house.</p>

<p>They could get nothing out of her about the event of
the night, save that she had been searching for the Christchild
in the forest. Then she came over to my bed and
looked at me, and I was scared at her eyes.</p>

<p>In the back part of our house was a room in which
there were only old, useless things and a lot of cobwebs.
This room my father gave Moss-Maggie for a dwelling,
and put a stove and a bed and a table in it for her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>And she stayed with us. She would still very often
go rambling about in the forest, and bring home moss,
and then return and sit for hours upon her husband's
grave; from which she could never more tear herself
away to return to her own district&mdash;where, indeed, she
would have been just as lonely and homeless as everywhere
else. Of her circumstances we could learn nothing
more definite: we could only conjecture that the woman
had once been happy and certainly in her right mind;
and that grief for the loss of her mate had robbed her of
reason.</p>

<p>We all loved her, for she lived peacefully and contentedly
with all and caused nobody the least trouble.
The house-dog alone, it seemed, would never trust her,
he barked and tore furiously at the chain whenever she
came across the home meadow. But the creature was
meaning something quite different than we thought, all
the time; for once when the chain broke he rushed to the
woman, leapt whining into her bosom and licked her
cheeks.</p>

<p>At last in the late autumn, when Moss-Maggie was
almost always in the graveyard, there came a time when,
instead of barking cheerily, the dog howled by the hour
together, so that my grandmother, herself very worn and
weary by then, said, "You mark my words; there'll soon
be somebody dying in our neighbourhood now, when the
dog howls like that! God comfort the poor soul!"</p>

<p>And a little while after that Moss-Maggie fell ill, and
when winter came she died.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In her last moments she held both my father and
mother by the hand and uttered the words, "May God
requite you a thousand and a thousandfold, right up
into heaven itself!"</p>

A Last Will and Testament</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">When</span> of a Saturday evening my father sat at his
shaving I had to creep under the table because it
was dangerous above.</p>

<p>When my father sat shaving himself, and when he had
lathered his cheek and lips to such a snowy whiteness
that he looked like the herd-boy after he has been lapping
cream behind the milkmaid's back; when, further,
he sharpened his gleaming razor on his brown-leather
braces and then passed it slowly over his cheek, he would
straightway begin to twist mouth, cheeks, and nose&mdash;indeed,
his whole countenance&mdash;in such a fashion as
made his dear kind face quite unrecognisable. He
drew both lips deep into his mouth, till he was like
nothing so much as old neighbour Veit who had lost all
his teeth; or he stretched his mouth crosswise, from left
to right, like Köhler-Sani scolding his hens; and he
screwed one eye up tight and blew out a cheek, for all
the world like poor Tinili the tailor, after his virago wife
had been caressing him. All the funniest faces in the
whole neighbourhood came to my mind in turn when
my father sat at his shaving. And that set me off.</p>

<p>At this point my father, still friendly, would say, "Do
be quiet, laddie." But scarcely had he spoken when
again there came such a wonderful face that I simply
couldn't help laughing outright. He peered into the
little looking-glass, and I fully expected to see his distorted
features relax into a smile. Then he suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
called out, "If you're not quiet, boy, I'll break the
shaving-brush over your pate!"</p>

<p>It was now high time to creep under the table, where
my smothered giggles kept me shaking like a wet poodle.
After that he could shave peacefully and without danger
of breaking out into untimely mirth over his own or my
grimaces.</p>

<p>And so it came to pass one winter evening that my
father was sitting before the soap-bowl and I under the
table when I heard someone in the entrance stamping
the snow from his boots. A moment later the door
opened and in came a big man whose thick red beard
had icicles hanging from it just like our shingle roof
outside. He at once sat down on a bench, drew a big
tobacco-pipe from under his homespun cloak, gripped it
between his front teeth, and, while striking a light, remarked,
"Having a shave, Farmer?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm having a bit of a shave," answered my
father, and went on scraping with the razor, and cut a
really God-forsaken grimace.</p>

<p>"That's all right," said the stranger.</p>

<p>And later, when he was quite hidden in tobacco smoke
and the icicles were dripping from his beard, he uttered
himself thus:</p>

<p>"I don't know if so be you know me or not, Farmer.
Five year agone I passed your place and took a drink of
water at your spring. I come from Stanz; I'm Frau
Drachenbinder's farm-hand, and I've come about the
matter of that big lad of yours."</p>

<p>Under the table, I went hot to the tips of my toes at
these words. My father had but one big lad at the time,
and that was myself. I drew back into the darkest corner.</p>

<p>"Come about my boy?" returned my father. "You
can have him if you want him&mdash;we can easily spare him;
he's just too bad for anything!"</p>

<p>(Peasant folk are very fond of talking like that for the
sake of teasing and overaweing their forward children.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>"Come, come, Farmer! Not so bad as all that!
Frau Drachenbinder wants to get something written
down&mdash;a will or some such matter&mdash;and she don't know
anybody, far and wide, that's a good writing scholar.
But now she's heard tell that the farmer at Vorderalpel
has got an uncommon kind of boy that can do such things
as that with his little finger alone! And so she's sent me
off here, and I was to beg of you, Farmer, if you'd be so
kind as to lend her the loan of the boy over there for a
day. She'll soon pack him off back again, and give him
something for his trouble as well."</p>

<p>When I heard him say that I rattled my shoe-tips
against the table legs: that wouldn't come at all amiss,
I thought.</p>

<p>"Go along with you!" said my father when he had
scratched one cheek quite smooth. "However is my
small boy to go to Stanz in the dead of winter? It must
be at least a four hours' walk!"</p>

<p>"Just so," answered the big man, "and that's why
I'm here. He's only got to climb up on my back and
open his legs and shove 'em along past my ribs, both sides
of me, towards the front, where I'll lay hold of them;
and then he must hug me round the neck with his hands,
like as if he was my sweetheart, so that he don't go
falling off backwards."</p>

<p>"I see," replied my father; "you needn't make such
a talk about a pig-a-back ride!"</p>

<p>"Well, after that I'll manage all right, and when
Sunday comes I'll bring him back home again."</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid of your not bringing him back safe
and sound," said my father; "and if Frau Drachenbinder
really wants to have something written down, and
seeing that you're her man, and if the lad will go with
you&mdash;there's no objection so far as I'm concerned."</p>

<p>He uttered these words with a smooth, ordinary
countenance.</p>

<p>A little later I was rigged out in my Sunday clothes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Elated with my so suddenly acquired importance I
strutted up and down the room.</p>

<p>"You wandering Jew, you!" exclaimed my father.
"Haven't you got anything to sit upon?"</p>

<p>But there was no more peace for me. Better than anything
I should have liked to settle myself there and then
on the big man's broad back, and ride straight away.
But just then my mother came in bringing a steaming
savoury dish, saying, "Eat that, you two, before you
start off!"</p>

<p>Not in vain did she say it. I had never yet seen our
biggest wooden spoon piled up so high as then when the
strange big man plied it between the meat-platter and
his bearded mouth. But I walked up and down all the
while and thought about how I was going to become
Frau Drachenbinder's scrivener.</p>

<p>Presently, when matters had gone so far that my
mother could turn the dish upside-down on the hearth
without a crumb falling out, I hopped up on to the man's
back, held on hard by his beard, and rode away in the
name of God.</p>

<p>The sun was already setting; the valleys were full of
blue shadow; the far snow-heights of the Alps were a
dull rose-colour.</p>

<p>So long as my nag was trotting uphill over the bare
pastures the snow bore his weight well, but when he
came in among the young larch and pine-woods the surface
became treacherous and broke under him. He was
prepared for that, however. When he came up to an old
hollow larch with wild arms stretching out into the air,
he pulled up, thrust his right hand into the dark cavity,
and fished out a pair of snow-shoes of woven willow
which he bound under his shoe-soles. Upon these wide
things he began the pilgrimage anew. Progress was slow,
for in order to manage the shoes he must keep them far
apart; but with such duck's feet there was no more
breaking through.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>Suddenly&mdash;it was already dark and the stars shining
clear&mdash;my mount began to undo my shoes, pulled them
clean off my feet and put them away in his turned-up
apron. Then he said, "Now, laddie, stick your little
hoofs in my breeches pocket, so that your toes don't
freeze off." He took my hands in his own and breathed
warm breath upon them&mdash;and that was instead of gloves.</p>

<p>The cold bit my cheeks, the snow creaked under
the snow-shoes; I rode on lonely through the forest and
over the heights. I rode all along the ridge of the Hochbürstling,
where even in summer I had never yet been.
Now and again, when progress was too deliberate, I
pressed my knees into the yielding flesh, and my horse
took it all in good part, going on as well as ever he could&mdash;there
was no doubt about his knowing the way! I
rode past a post whereon, summer and winter, that holy
patron of cattle, St. Erhardi, stood. I knew St. Erhardi
at home, he and I between us had charge of my father's
herd. He was always much carefuller than I: if a cow
came to grief, I the herdboy was blamed; if the others
throve, St. Erhardi got the credit for it.&mdash;It did my
heart good he should see that I had become a horseman
while he stood there nailed to his post for ever and ever.</p>

<p>At last our path took a turn and I began riding downwards
over stumps and stones, making towards a little
light that glimmered in the valley below. And just when
all the trees and places had passed me by and I had
nothing but the dark mass with the one little pane of
shining light before me, my good Christopher came to a
halt and said, "Now look here, my dear boy&mdash;seeing as
how I'm a stranger to you and you've come with me like
this without taking thought what you were doing&mdash;how
d'you know that I mayn't have got a life-long grudge
against your father and am just now going to carry you
into a robbers' den?"</p>

<p>I listened a moment. Then, as he added nothing to
these words, I answered in the same tone:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>"Considering my father trusted me to Frau Drachenbinder's
man and that I've come with him like this, it's
not likely Drachenbinder's man has got a grudge against
us, and he won't carry me into a robbers' den."</p>

<p>At these words of mine the man snorted into his beard,
and soon after he lowered me on to the stump of a tree,
saying, "And now here we are at Frau Drachenbinder's
house."</p>

<p>He opened a door in the dark mass and went in.</p>

<p>The small living-room had a stove with glowing embers
on it, a burning pine-splinter,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6" href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and a straw bed with a
child asleep on it. Near it stood a woman, very old and
bent and with a face as pallid and creased as the coarse
nightgown she was wearing. As we entered, this person
uttered a strange cry, a sort of crowing, began to laugh
violently, and then hid herself behind the stove.</p>

<p>"That's Frau Drachenbinder," remarked my guide.
"She'll soon come and speak to you, and meantime you
sit down there on the stool near the bed and put on your
shoes again."</p>

<p>I did what he bade me, and he seated himself on a
block of wood near by.</p>

<p>When the woman became composed, she moved lightly
about the stove and soon brought us a steaming grey
meal-soup in an earthenware pot, and two bone spoons
with it. My man ate solemnly and steadily, but I couldn't
quite fancy it. Then he got up and said softly to me,
"Sleep well, boy!" and went away. And when I found
myself alone in the close room with the sleeping
child and the old woman I began to feel downright
creepy.</p>

<p>Frau Drachenbinder came up to me, laid her light,
lean hand on my cheek, and said, "I thank the dear
Lord God that you've come!&mdash;It's barely six months
since my daughter died. That there"&mdash;she pointed to
the child&mdash;"is my young branch&mdash;such a dear mite&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
he's my heir. And now I hear Death knocking at
the door again. I'm very old. I've saved all my life&mdash;I'm
going to beg my coffin from kind folks' charity.
My husband died long ago and left this little house
to me. My illnesses have cost me the house&mdash;but they
weren't worth it. Whatever I leave behind me is for
my grandchild's very own. As yet he's too young to
take it into his heart, and I can't give it into any man's
hand, and so I want to have it written down so that it's
kept. I won't do it through the schoolmaster in Stanz,
and the doctor can't do it without the stamp-duty. And
then people told me about the son of the farmer at
Vorderalpel, and how he was such a scholar that he
could write out people's last wills without the stamp!
That's why I've had you brought all this long way.
Do this favour for me to-morrow, and to-night go and
get a good rest."</p>

<p>She ushered me, by the light of the burning splinter,
into the little room adjoining. It was made only of
boards. A bed of hay, with a covering in the shape of the
woman's thick, best Sunday dress, was there, and in a
corner stood a little brown church with two small towers in
which little bells were set a-tinkling whenever one trod the
shaky floor. Frau Drachenbinder stuck the burning pine-wood
in the window of one of the towers, made the sign
of the cross on me with her thumb, and then I was alone
in the room. It was cold: I was shivering with the bitter
winter, and with a fear of my hostess too, but, before ever
I crept into my nest, curiosity impelled me to open the
door of the little church. Out sprang a mouse who had
just made her supper off the gold-paper altar and St.
Joseph's cardboard hand. Saints and angels were there
within, and gay banners and wreaths&mdash;it was a lovely
toy. I thought to myself that this must be Frau Drachenbinder's
parish church, for the little body was far too
feeble to walk to Stanz for mass. I said my evening
prayer before it, asking Our Lord to protect me during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
that night; then I extinguished the splinter so that it
should not burn right down to the window-frame, and
after that laid myself down on the hay, in God's name.</p>

<p>It seemed to me as if I had been torn away from myself
and were some learned clerk in a far-away cold house,
while the real boy of the forest farm was sleeping at home
in his own warm little nest. Just as I was falling asleep
I heard the short, sharp cries of joy again in the living-room,
and soon after that the loud laughter. Whatever
was it that delighted her so much, and at whom was she
laughing? I was terrified, and thought of running
away. One of the boards could be easily shifted, but
then&mdash;the snow!</p>

<p>Only towards morning did I fall asleep, and I dreamed
and dreamed about a red mouse that had bitten off the
right hand of all the saints in the church. And my
father was looking out of the window of the tower with
his lathered, distorted cheeks and holding a lighted pine-splinter
in his mouth: and I sobbed and giggled together,
and was hot with fear. When at last I awoke I thought
I was in a cage with silver bars, for so the white daylight
looked through the vertical cracks in the woodwork.
And when I went outside the house door I was astonished
to see how narrow the ravine was, and how high and
wintry the mountains.</p>

<p>Within doors the child was screaming, and then Frau
Drachenbinder broke out into her jubilant cries again.</p>

<p>At breakfast there was my horse again, but he hardly
spoke at all, giving all his attention to his food; and
when that was finished he got up, put on his huge hat,
and went off to church at Stanz.</p>

<p>When the old woman had comforted the child, fed
the fowls, and done other household work, she pushed
the wooden bolt of the house door, went into the inner
room, and began ringing the bells of the little church.
She lighted two candles that stood on the altar, and then
she made a prayer, and one more moving have I never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
heard. She knelt before the church, held out her hands,
and murmured: "By the most sacred wound of Thy
right hand, O my crucified Saviour, save my parents if
they be still in torment. Though they have lain for half
a century in the earth I can still hear my father in the
dead of night crying out for help.&mdash;By the most sacred
wound of Thy left hand I commend to Thee the soul
of my daughter. She had hardly looked round upon
the world and she was just going to lay her little
one in her husband's arms, when up comes cruel Death
and takes and buries her out of our sight!&mdash;By the
most sacred wound of Thy right foot, I pray Thee from
my very heart for my husband, and for my kindred
and benefactors, and that Thou wilt not forget this
little lad from the forest farm.&mdash;By the most sacred
wound of Thy left foot, O crucified Saviour, in love
and mercy remember also all my enemies, who have
smitten me with their hands and trodden me with
their feet. Blinded men crucified Thee to death, and yet
Thou hast forgiven them.&mdash;By the most holy wound of
Thy sacred side, I invoke Thee a thousand and a thousand
times.&mdash;O crucified God, take up my grandchild to Thy
Divine Heart. His father is far away with the soldiers,
and perhaps I have not long to live. Be Thou a guardian
to the child, I beseech Thee."</p>

<p>That was how she prayed. The little red candles
burned devoutly. At that moment it seemed to me that
if I were Our Lord I would come down from Heaven
and take the child in my arms, and say, "See for yourself,
Frau Drachenbinder, I am holding him close to My
heart, and I will be his guardian." I would let him grow
white wings, so that he could fly away to the Better Land.</p>

<p>But then, I wasn't Our Lord.</p>

<p>Presently Frau Drachenbinder said, "Now let's get
to the writing." But when we wanted to begin there
was no ink and no pen and no paper. We had forgotten
every one of these things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>The old woman leant her head on her palm, murmuring,
"What a misfortune!"</p>

<p>I had heard somewhere the story of the doctor who
in default of the necessary things wrote his prescription
on the door of the room with chalk. His example was
worth following now; but there was no chalk to be
found in the house. I didn't know what else to suggest,
and was unspeakably ashamed of being a scribe without
a pen.</p>

<p>"My boy," said the woman suddenly, "maybe you
learned to write with charcoal too?"</p>

<p>Yes, yes&mdash;with the charcoal&mdash;just like that on the
hearth there; that would do!</p>

<p>"And this, in God's name, must be my writing-paper,"
she went on, and lifted the lid of an old coffer
standing near the stove. Inside the coffer I could see
cuttings of cloth, a piece of linen, and a rusty spade.
When she saw me looking at the spade, she looked sadly
confused, covered her old face with her brown apron,
muttering, "It's a real disgrace!"</p>

<p>I was stricken, for I took this to be a reproach for my
having no writing things about me.</p>

<p>"I expect you'll be making fun of me," she said.
"But don't you go and think badly of me&mdash;I can't do
more than I do, I really couldn't do a thing more&mdash;I'm
a fairly worn-out old body!"</p>

<p>Then I thought I understood: the poor old woman
felt herself disgraced because she could no longer handle
the spade, and it had therefore gone rusty. I looked
about on the hearth for a bit of soft charcoal. The pine-tree
was obliging, and lent me the pen wherewith to
write out Frau Drachenbinder's will, or whatever it
might prove to be.</p>

<p>Just when the grey coffer was opened and I standing
there ready to take down her words, that they might
deliver their message to her grandchild in the years to
come, the old woman beside me uttered a loud cry. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
turned away quickly, crowed again, and then broke into
hoarse laughter.</p>

<p>In terror I broke the charcoal in my fingers and
glanced askance at the door.</p>

<p>When she had done laughing, she grew quiet, drew a
deep breath, wiped the sweat from her face, and turning
again to me, said, "Write this&mdash;it won't come to much
altogether&mdash;still, you'd best begin up in the top corner,
there."</p>

<p>I placed my hand on the topmost corner of the lid.
Then the woman spoke as follows:</p>

<p>"One and one is God alone.&mdash;That, child of my child,
is thy very own."</p>

<p>I wrote this on the wood.</p>

<div class="writing">
<span class="i0">"Two and two," she went on, "Two and two is man and wife.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three and three the child of their life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Four and five to eight and nine&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For griefs are countless, darling mine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pray as if thou hadst no hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Work as if thou knewest no God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Carry fuel, and think the while,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God will cook the broth for me."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>When I had written these things, Frau Drachenbinder
let down the coffer lid, bolted it carefully, and said,
"You've done me a great service&mdash;and there's a great
stone lifted off my heart. That coffer there is my legacy
to my grandchild.&mdash;And now you must tell me what I
owe you for this."</p>

<p>I shook my head. I wouldn't ask for anything, not
anything at all.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;learn to write so finely and then come all
this long way and suffer cold the long night through
and then in the end take nothing for it&mdash;that would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
fine indeed!" she cried. "Why, my boy, I couldn't
allow it!"</p>

<p>I glanced through the open door into the next room
where the little church stood. It certainly would be
heavenly company for my little bed at home. She
guessed at once. "You're thinking of my little house-altar!"
she said. "Then, in God's name, you shall have
it. I can't shut it up in the chest&mdash;my dear little
church&mdash;and the people would only steal it from me
when I'm gone. With you it will be respected, I know,
and you'll think of old Frau Drachenbinder in sacred
moments, when you're saying your prayers."</p>

<p>And she gave me the little church as it stood. And
that was the greatest bliss of all my childhood.</p>

<p>I dearly wanted to take it on my shoulders at once
and carry it away over the hills to my home. But she
said, "You dear little goose, that's impossible. When
the man's back, he'll contrive something for you."</p>

<p>And sure enough, when the man was back again and
had eaten the midday meal with us, he knew what to do.
He bound the little church on to my back with a string,
then stooped down in front of the wood block, and said,
"Now, boy, mount again!" So for the second time I
got up on his back, thrust my feet in his breeches pockets,
and clung with my hands round his neck. The old woman
held the waking child so that it might put out its little
hand to me, uttered more thanks, and then dived behind
the stove and crowed as before.</p>

<p>I rode away from the place, and with every movement
the saints in the church kept tapping behind my back
and the bells in the towers kept tinkling.</p>

<p>When the man had climbed with me as far as the
heights of the Bürstling, and there again bound the snow-shoes
fast to his feet, I asked him why Frau Drachenbinder
was continually screaming for joy and laughing.</p>

<p>"That's not screaming nor yet laughing neither," said
my horse; "Frau Drachenbinder has a lot of suffering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
to bear. For some years she used to have a sort of catch
in the breath&mdash;such as you may get through a chill or
the like: she didn't take any notice of it, let it just go
its own way, and so, little by little, the barber says, that
cramp-crowing and cramp-laughing came on. Her inside
just twists itself up together, and when she gets
excited the fits come on strong. She can hardly touch
any food, and she's face to face with death all the time."</p>

<p>I said nothing. I looked up at the snow-white heights,
at the twilight forests, and saw we were gradually climbing
down towards my home in the clear Sunday afternoon.
I was thinking about the little church I had got
as a legacy&mdash;how I would set it up in the living-room
and hold a service in it, and how my father and mother
would now no longer have to trudge all that long way to
the parish church.</p>

<p>My good horse trotted patiently on, and behind me all
the way the little bells in the towers kept on chiming.
What were they saying?&hellip;</p>

<p>Old Frau Drachenbinder died soon after that.</p>

How Little Maxel's House was
Burned Down</h2>


<p class="cap2"><span class="upper">How</span> well I remember that night!</p>

<p>A dull report, as if the trap-door of the hay-loft
had slammed to, woke me up. And then someone
rapped on the window and called into the living-room:
whoever wanted to see little Maxel's house burning must
get up and go and look.</p>

<p>My father sprang out of bed; I began to cry, and
immediately thought about rescuing my rabbit. When
other people lost their heads in moments of emergency
it was always blind Julia, our old servant, who calmed
us down again. So now, too, she remarked it wasn't our
house that was burning, but little Maxel's, and that was
half an hour away; that it was not even certain that
little Maxel's house was burning; that a wag, passing by,
had thrown the lie in through the window; and that
quite possibly no one <em>had</em> done so at all, but it had only
happened to us in a dream.</p>

<p>Meanwhile she pulled on my breeches and shoes, and
we hurried out of the house to look.</p>

<p>"Oh dear! oh dear!" cried my father. "It's all
gone already!"</p>

<p>Over the Waldrücken, which stretches like a wide-bowed
saddle across our part of the country, dividing
it into Highlands and Lowlands, the flame streamed
steady and clear toward us. No hissing nor crackling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
was to be heard; the beautiful new house, only finished
a few weeks before, was burning like oil. The air was
damp, the stars were hidden; now and again there was
a growl of thunder, but the storm was drawing gently
away in the direction of Berkfeld and Weitz.</p>

<p>The lightning&mdash;so the man who had wakened us now
said&mdash;had been darting hither and thither, had described
a great cross in the sky, and then descended. The
fiery point at its lower end had never died out, but had
grown rapidly larger, and then he&mdash;the man&mdash;had
thought to himself, "There now, it's gone and struck
little Maxel's!"</p>

<p>"We must go and see if we can't do something to
help," said my father.</p>

<p>"Help, would you?" rejoined the other. "Where the
thunderbolt falls, <em>I</em> shan't meddle! Man mustn't work
against his Maker, and if He casts fire upon a house He
certainly intends that house to burn. Besides, you know,
anything struck by lightning can't be quenched!"</p>

<p>"Nor your idiocy neither!" cried my father; and
then, angry as I had seldom seen him, he shouted in his
face, "You've been struck silly!"</p>

<p>He left him standing there, and took me by the hand
and quickly away. We descended into the Engtal and
went along by the Fresenbach, where we could see the
fire no longer, only the fiery clouds. My father carried a
two-handled pail, and I advised him to fill it at the
Fresen. My father didn't listen, but said several times
to himself, "Maxel&mdash;to think of that happening to
Maxel!"</p>

<p>I knew little Maxel quite well. He was an active,
cheery little chap, somewhere in the forties; his face
was full of pock-marks, and his hands were brown and
rough as the bark of the forest trees. So long as
I could remember he had been a woodcutter in
Waldbach.</p>

<p>"If it was anyone else's house that was burning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
down," said my father, "well&mdash;it would just be his
house burning down!"</p>

<p>"Isn't it the same with little Maxel?" I asked.</p>

<p>"With him it's his all that's being burnt: everything
that he had yesterday, and has to-day, and might have
had to-morrow."</p>

<p>"D'you mean the lightning has struck Maxel himself?"</p>

<p>"It were better so, boy! I don't grudge him his life&mdash;God
knows I don't grudge it him&mdash;but if he might have
confessed first, and not been in any mortal sin, I could
say downright it were best for him if the lightning had
struck him too."</p>

<p>"Then he would be already up there in Heaven," I
remarked.</p>

<p>"Here, don't go paddling about in that wet grass.
Keep close behind me and catch on by my coat-tail.
About Maxel&mdash;I'll tell you something about him."</p>

<p>The path sloped gently upwards. My father said, "It
must be about thirty years since Maxel came. Poor
people's child. At first he went out as herdboy among
the peasants; later, when he'd grown up a bit, he went
in for the woodcutting&mdash;a thorough workman, and
always industrious and thrifty. When he became foreman,
he asked the landlord to allow him to clear the
Sour Meadow on the Gfarerhöhe and keep it for life,
because he was so mighty set upon having his own little
bit of land. This was willingly granted, and so, every
day, when his woodcutting hours were over, Maxel was
up there on the Sour Meadow, cutting away the undergrowth
and trenching it, and grubbing up stones and
burning the roots of the weeds; and in two years the
whole place was drained; and there's good grass growing
there, and he's even sown a little patch of rye. When
he'd got on so far that he had tried it with cabbage
and seen how much the hares relished it, he set about
getting some timber. They couldn't give him that, like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
the Sour Meadow&mdash;he must purchase it with labour. So
he let his wages stand, and he felled the trees and hewed
them square and cut them up for building timber, and
all that in the free time when the other workmen were
long since lying on their stomachs smoking their pipes!
And the next thing was he began to get some of the
other woodcutters to help him at such work as a man
couldn't do single-handed, and this way he built his
house on the Sour Meadow. Five years he laboured at
it, but there&mdash;you've seen for yourself how it stood there
with the golden-red walls, with the clear windows, and
the decoration all round the roof&mdash;something grand to
see! There's quite a fine little property been made of
the Sour Meadow; and how long ago was it that our
pastor in the catechism class held little Maxel up as an
example of energy and industry? Next month he was
meaning to get married: and to think he's risen from
being a poor pauper lad to the brave householder and
house-father!&mdash;Take off your cap to him, boy&mdash;And
now suddenly there's an end of everything; all the industry
and toil of years has gone for nothing; Maxel
stands again to-day on the same spot as he did at the
very beginning."</p>

<p>At that time I derived all my piety from the Bible,
and so I met my father's story with: "Our Heavenly
Father has punished Maxel because he was set upon
earthly things like the heathen, and has probably taken
too little thought for Eternity. Look at the birds of the
air, they sow not, neither do they reap&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue!" interrupted my father angrily.
"The man who said that was King Solomon&mdash;it's easy
enough for <em>him</em> to say it: only let some of our sort try
it! I wouldn't be sure of myself; if it happened to me
like little Maxel, I should just lose all heart&mdash;I'd just
turn idle and good for nothing. Why, if a man puts a
match to a thatched roof he's put in prison, and quite
right too&mdash;he doesn't deserve anything better. But when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Someone throws fire down out of Heaven on a brand-new
house that a poor, plucky working-man has built&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped himself. We were now upon the height,
and in front of us blazed the homestead of little Maxel.
The house was just falling in. Several people were there
with axes and pails, but there was nothing to be done
but just stand and look on as the last charred bits
tumbled into ruins. The fire wasn't raging, it didn't
roar nor crackle, it didn't flicker wildly in the air: the
whole house was just one flame rising, hot and steady,
towards the Heaven whence it had come.</p>

<p>A little way off from the conflagration lay the stone-heap
where Maxel had carried the stones from the Sour
Meadow. Thereon he was now sitting, the little brown,
pock-marked man, and looking at the furnace, the heat
of which was streaming towards him. He was half clad,
had thrown his black Sunday coat, the only thing he had
rescued, over him. The neighbours were holding a little
aloof. My father greatly desired to utter a word of sympathy
and comfort, but somehow he too didn't venture
to go near him. Maxel went on sitting there in a way
that made us think every moment, now, <em>now</em> he would
leap up and utter some fearful curse against Heaven,
and then throw himself into the flames!</p>

<p>And at last, when the fire was only licking the ground
and the bare wall of the hearth was staring out of the
ashes, Maxel got up. He walked over to the glowing
mass, picked up an ember, and lighted his pipe with it.</p>

<p>I was still very small at that time and didn't think
much. But this I remember: when I saw little Maxel
in that dawn-twilight standing before the burnt ruin of
his home, sucking the blue smoke from his pipe and
blowing it away from him, my heart grew suddenly hot
within me. As if I felt how mighty man is, how much
greater than his fate, and how there was no finer scorning
of it than calmly blowing tobacco-smoke in its
face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>And when the pipe was well alight, he sat down again
on the stone-heap and gazed away into the distance.
You would like to know what he was thinking? So
should I.</p>

<p>Later, little Maxel went rummaging among the ashes
of his house, and drew from them his great wood-axe,
and made it sharp again on a grindstone of the neighbourhood
and set to work again. Since then many years
have passed, and to-day on the Sour Meadow there lie
beautiful fields, and on the place of the burnt-out farm
a new one has arisen. It is lively with young folk, and
the house-father, little Maxel, teaches his sons to work&mdash;but
also allows them to smoke. Not too much, but just
a pipe in due season.</p>

Three Hundred and Sixty-four
Nights and a Night</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> white kid was gone.</p>

<p>But my father still had four big nanny-goats in
the stable, just as he had four children, who always stood
in close relationship to the goats. Each of the goats had
her own little manger, out of which she ate hay or clover
while we milked her. Not one of them would give milk
at an empty manger. The goats were called Zitzerl,
Zutzerl, Zeitzerl and Heitzerl, and were the property of
us children&mdash;a welcome present which father had made
us. Zitzerl and Zutzerl belonged to my two little sisters;
Zeitzerl to my eight-year-old brother Jakoberle; Heitzerl
was mine!</p>

<p>Each of us faithfully tended and looked after his
allotted charge; but we put all the milk together in a
pot, mother boiled it, father gave us the slices of bread
that went with it&mdash;and the Lord God blessed the spoonful
of soup for us.</p>

<p>And, when we had ladled up our suppers with our
broad wooden spoons, which had been carved by our
uncle and which, because of their size, would hardly go
into our mouths in the first place or out of them in the
second, we would each of us take our horsehair pillow and
lie down, one and all, in the goats' mangers. These
were our beds for a time; and the beloved animals used
to fan our cheeks with their soft beards and lick our little
noses with their tongues.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>But, when we lay thus in our cribs, we did not always
go to sleep at the very first lick. My head was crammed
with a multitude of wonderful stories and fairy-tales of
our grandfathers. I would tell these stories in those
evening-hours; and my brothers and sisters revelled in
them and even the goats were fond of listening to them
too. Only now and again, when the thing struck them
as too incredible, they would give a little bleat to themselves
or bang at the mangers impatiently with their
horns. Once, when I was telling of the corn-wraith
who blackens the oats when she cries at midnight in the
fields, and eats nothing but the grey beards of old charcoal
burners, my Heitzerl began to bleat so violently
that the other three joined in until at last my brother
and sisters burst into wild peals of laughter and I was
shamefully obliged to hold my tongue like a convicted
boaster.</p>

<p>For a long time after that, I told my sleeping-companions
no more stories and I resolved never to speak
another word to Heitzerl so long as I lived.</p>

<p>Then came Ascension Day, on which day mother made
us the usual egg-cake, my favourite dish in all the world.
That year, however, the hawks had taken our best
laying-hens; the egg-basket would not fill; and, when
the cake appeared on Ascension Day, it was only a tiny
little loaf. I gave a woe-begone look at the wooden dish.</p>

<p>My little five-year-old sister peeped up at me; and,
as though noticing my longing, she suddenly cried:</p>

<p>"I say, Peterle, look here! If you will tell us a short
story every night for a whole year long, I will give you
my share of the cake."</p>

<p>Strange to say, the others all chimed in and echoed
this noble renunciation on the little one's part; they
clapped their hands; and&mdash;I entered into the bargain.
So, suddenly, had I attained the object of my desire.</p>

<p>I tucked my cake under my jacket and went with it to
the dairy, where no one could see or disturb me. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
bolted the door, sat down on an overturned tub and
allowed my ten fingers and the well-ordered host of my
teeth to work their will on the poor cake.</p>

<p>But now came this anxiety. There could not be a
doubt that my brother and sisters would insist strictly
on their due. When I went out a-herding, I begged a
story of every pitch-maker, every charcoal-burner, every
keeper and every knowing little woman that I met in
the wood and on the fields. They were productive
sources, and I was able to meet my liabilities every
evening. Meanwhile, of course, it was a daily misery
until I hit upon something fresh; and, after a time, it
happened not seldom that little sister would interrupt
me and call out from her manger:</p>

<p>"Look here, we know that one! You have told it us
before!"</p>

<p>I could see that I must think of new ways and I therefore
struggled to improve my reading, so as to draw
treasures from the many story-books which lay idling
on the sooty shelves in our little house in the forest.
Now I had new sources: the story of the Countess-palatine
(Jakoberle always said, "The Countess-Gelatine")
Genovefa; the four sons of Aymon; the Fair
Melusina; Wendelin von Höllenstein: wonderful things
by the dozen. And my brother would often say from
his manger:</p>

<p>"I don't mind going without my cake a bit! This is
just <em>too</em> lovely. What do you say, Zeitzerl?"</p>

<p>Now the evenings grew too short; and I had to tell
some of these stories in serials and sequels, a proceeding
to which little sister refused point-blank to agree, for she
stuck to it that a <em>whole</em> story every night was what we
bargained for.</p>

<p>So the year went by. Little by little, I acquired a
real skill in telling stories and even told them in High
German, as they stood printed in the books! And it often
happened that, during the telling, my listeners buried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
themselves in their coverlets and began to groan with
fright at the stories of robbers and ghosts; but I was not
allowed to stop, for all that!</p>

<p>Ascension Day was very nearly there again, and with
it, the completion of my bargain. But&mdash;it was like my
luck!&mdash;just before the last evening, my thread gave out
entirely. All my recollections, all the books which I
could get hold of, all the little men and women whom I
met were exhausted, drained, pumped dry beyond all
hope. I implored my brother and sisters:</p>

<p>"To-morrow is the last evening; make me a present
of it!"</p>

<p>There was a general outcry:</p>

<p>"No, no, no presents! You got your Ascension cake!"</p>

<p>Even the goats bleated their approval.</p>

<p>The next day, I went about like a lost sheep. Then
the thought suddenly came to me: "Deceive them!
<em>Invent</em> something!"</p>

<p>But my conscience at once stepped in and cried aloud:</p>

<p>"What you tell must be real! You really had the
cake!"</p>

<p>Nevertheless, an event occurred in the course of that
day which made me hope that, in the heat of the excitement,
it would release me from my duty.</p>

<p>My brother Jakoberle lost his Zeitzerl. He went this
way and that over the heath, he went into the wood and,
crying and calling, hunted for the goat. But, at last,
he brought her home, late in the evening. We ate our
porridge quietly and went to our cribs; and a story was
expected of me.</p>

<p>All was silent. The listeners waited eagerly. The
goats clashed their teeth together as they chewed the cud.</p>

<p>"Very well, they shall have their story," said I.</p>

<p>I reflected. I began:</p>

<p>"There was once a great, great wood. And everything
in the wood was dark. No little birds sang: only
the screech-owl's cry was heard. But, even though the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
other birds had sung, all the boughs and all the leaves
on the trees wept thousands and thousands of tears.
In the middle of this wood is a heath, silent as the graveyard;
and he who goes over it and does not turn back
is never seen again. Once upon a time, two knees went
over this heath; and inside those knees was blood."</p>

<p>"Jesus Mar&hellip;!" gasped the elder of my little sisters;
and all three crept under their coverlets.</p>

<p>"Yes, two knees with blood inside them," I continued,
"and they passed over the heath towards the dark wood,
like a lost soul. But, all at once, the two bloody
knees&hellip;."</p>

<p>"I say, I'll give you my blue trouser-belt if you stop!"
whimpered my brother in his fear and hid still deeper
in the coverlet.</p>

<p>"The two bloody knees stopped," I continued, "and
on the ground lay a stone as white as a winding-sheet.
Then two flickering lights appeared between the trees;
and thereupon four more knees, <em>all with blood</em>&mdash;hovered
to the same place&hellip;."</p>

<p>"I'll give you my new pair of shoes if you stop!"
Jakoberle panted in his trough and, for sheer terror,
drew Zeitzerl to him by her beard.</p>

<p>"And so they all six together passed through the dark
wood and out upon the heath and over the oat-field to
our house &hellip; and here into the stable&hellip;."</p>

<p>Now they all three cried out and whimpered; and
there was no end to their terror, and my little sister
timidly promised me her share of to-morrow's Ascension
cake, which was expected this year too, if I would only
stop. But I went on:</p>

<p>"Well, ah, yes, I forgot to begin by saying that the
first two knees&mdash;with blood&mdash;belonged to our Jakoberle
and the last four to his Zeitzerl &hellip; as they went about
in the wood to-day."</p>

<p>Suddenly, they all burst out laughing.</p>

<p>"Why, everybody has two knees with blood in them!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
cried little sister; and the goats bleated their share of
the jubilation.</p>

<p>I had played my part right out. For three hundred
and sixty-four nights long, I had shone as a wise and
veracious story-teller; the three-hundred-and-sixty-fifth
had unmasked me as a deceitful humbug. The promise
of the second Ascension cake was withdrawn; little
sister declared that her offer had been made in self-defence.</p>

<p>And I had shattered the confidence of my public for
good and all; and, thereafter, whenever it wanted to
express its doubts of anything I related, it cried, with one
voice:</p>

<p>"Ah, that's only one of your old knees again!"</p>

How the White Kid Died</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">There</span> was yet another time when I just escaped
the birch.</p>

<p>My father had a snow-white kid, my Cousin Jok had
a snow-white head. The kid loved chewing stalks and
twigs; my cousin loved chewing a short pipe. We&mdash;I
and my younger brother and sisters&mdash;were ever so fond
of the kid and of Cousin Jok too. And so we lighted upon
the idea of bringing the kid and our cousin together.</p>

<p>One bright, sunny day in July, I took my brother and
my two sisters out into the cabbage-patch and there
put this question to them:</p>

<p>"Which of you has a hat without a hole in it?"</p>

<p>They examined their hats and caps, but the sun shone
through all of them, making little flecks of light in
the shadow on the ground. Only Jakoberle's hat was
without a flaw; so I took it in my hand and said:</p>

<p>"Cousin's called Jok and to-morrow is St. Jokopi's<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7" href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
Day. Now what shall we give him for a present on his
name-day? Why not the white kid?"</p>

<p>"The white kid belongs to father!" cried little sister
Plonele, shocked at this arbitrary suggestion.</p>

<p>"That's just why I am sending the hat round," said I.
"You, Jakoberle, sold your rabbit to Sepp, the Knierutscher,
yesterday; you, Plonele, have had three groschen
as a tip from your god-father; you, Mirzerle, got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
a present from father two days ago. Look, I'll put
in the five kreuzer which I've saved up; and we must
manage to buy the kid from father between us. And
then we'll give it to cousin to-morrow. Now here goes
for the collection!"</p>

<p>They looked into the hat for a moment and then began
to feel in their pockets. Then Plonele said, "Mother's
got my money!" And Mirzerle cried, in alarm, "I
don't know wherever mine's got to!" And Jakoberle
stared at the ground and muttered, "There must be a
hole in my pocket!"</p>

<p>And so my plan fell to pieces.</p>

<p>None the less, we petted and fondled the snow-white
kid. It stood up and put its fore-feet on our knees and
looked at us roguishly with its squinny eyes, as though
it were mocking us for not being rich enough to buy it
between the lot of us. It tittered and bleated at us like
anything and showed us its snow-white teeth. It was
hardly three months old and already had a beard; while
I and Jakoberle were seven years old and more and had
to make ourselves a beard of grey tree-moss when we
wanted one. And the kid ate even that off our faces!</p>

<p>In spite of that, each one of us was much fonder of
the little four-footed creature than of all the others put
together! And so I cast about for some other means
of rejoicing my cousin with the gift of the animal.</p>

<p>When father came home from the fields that afternoon,
we all swarmed about him and tugged at his clothes.</p>

<p>"Father," I asked, "is it true that 'The early morn
has gold in its mouth'?"</p>

<p>This being one of his own proverbs, he answered
promptly:</p>

<p>"Indeed it <em>is</em> true."</p>

<p>"Father!" the four of us immediately cried together.
"How early must we get up every day for you to give
us the white kid?"</p>

<p>Father did not seem to jump at this business view of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the matter. But, when he heard of our proposal to give
the kid to Cousin Jok, he bargained that we should get
up half an hour earlier every morning and thereupon
made the dear little beast over to us.</p>

<p>The kid was ours. We resolved with one accord to
creep out of bed next morning before cousin's time for
getting up&mdash;and that was saying a great deal&mdash;to tie a
red ribbon round the kid's neck and to take it to old
Jok's bedside before he thrust his body into his long
grey fur, which he wore winter and summer alike.</p>

<p>This was our sacred intention.</p>

<p>But, next day, when mother called us and we opened
our eyelids, the sun shone so fiercely into our eyes that
we had to shut them again until she covered the window
with her kerchief.</p>

<p>Now there was no excuse left. But cousin had gone
out long before, taking his fur with him. He had driven
the sheep and goats to the meadow in the valley where
he always tended them and where he sat all day smiling
and chewing his pipe. And the little animals nibbled
busily at the dewy grasses and shrubs and skipped and
gambolled merrily on the sunny meadow.</p>

<p>The little kid was among them. And had nobody
reminded Jok that this was his name-day?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At the time of which I speak, lucifer-matches had not
yet been invented and so the beloved fire was a precious
thing. You could not carry it in your pocket as easily
as to-day, without burning your trousers. It had to be
knocked out of stones with hard blows; no sooner
hatched, it must be fed with tinder, and it was long
ere it derived strength enough from this to peck at
coarser food and then become fledged. On every separate
occasion, fire had to be formally brought into the service
of man.</p>

<p>It was a toilsome and ticklish piece of work; my own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
mother, who was usually so gentle, could get quite cross
over it.</p>

<p>The glowing embers, however carefully preserved
overnight in the hearth, were generally dead by morning.
Whatever pains mother might take to blow up the sparks
in the ashes, it was all in vain: the fire had died during
the night. And then the striking with flint and steel
began, and we children were often quite hungry before
mother produced the fire that was to cook the morning-porridge.</p>

<p>So it was on the morning of cousin's name-day. We
had heard the bellows-blowing and fire-striking for some
time out in the kitchen. Then our mother suddenly
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"It's no good at all! One would think the devil had
spat on the hearth! And the flint hasn't a spark of fire
left in it, and the tinder's damp, and here's everybody
waiting for their porridge!"</p>

<p>Then she came into the room and said:</p>

<p>"Come, Peterle, quick, and run across as fast as you
can to the Knierutscher woman. Tell her that I beg
her to send me a handful of embers from her hearth.
And take her that loaf of bread over there for her
kindness. Hurry up, Peterle, so that we can get our
porridge quickly."</p>

<p>I had my little white linen breeches on in no time and,
as I was, barefoot and bareheaded, I took the heavy
round loaf under my arm and ran off to the Knierutschers'
house.</p>

<p>"You old sunshine!" I said, as I went. "You ought
to be ashamed of yourself, that you can't even warm a
mouthful of porridge, and here I've got to go running to
the Knierutscher woman for fire&mdash;But just you wait:
things will soon be bright and jolly on our hearth&mdash;the
flames will leap over the sticks, the walls will light up red,
the pots will bubble, the smoke will rush out of the hearth
and the chimney and hide you from sight! And quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
right too, for then we shall eat our porridge and our stew
in the shadow, and the pancake, too, that's to be fried
to-day for Cousin Jok, and you shall see nothing of all
these nice things!"</p>

<p>As I went down the hill after my lecture to the sun,
I had a happy thought. My loaf was as round as a ball
and as hard as if it had been turned out of larch-wood.
In my part of the country, they let bread grow stale,
because it makes it last twice as long; even though it
has occasionally to be smashed up, at mealtimes, with a
sledge-hammer.</p>

<p>Well, seeing that my loaf was so round that there was
nothing rounder on the face of the earth, I let it run
loose down the slope, raced nimbly after it and caught
it up again.</p>

<p>That was a thoroughly jolly game; and I should have
liked to call all my brothers and sisters to see it and
share in it. But, as I was jumping up and down the
slope in my delight, my loaf suddenly played me a trick
and darted like the wind between my legs. Hurrying
and hopping away it went, fleeter than a roe before
the hounds&mdash;it bounded down the hill, leapt far over the
edge into the valley below and vanished from my sight.</p>

<p>I stood there like a block, feeling as if I should drop
with fright and go rolling into the valley in my turn.
I went to and fro and up and down for a while; and,
then as I could nowhere see the loaf, I slunk with
hanging head into the Knierutschers' house.</p>

<p>There was a fine big fire burning on the hearth.</p>

<p>"What have you come for, Peterle?" asked Frau
Knierutscher, kindly.</p>

<p>"Our fire's gone out," I stammered, "we can't cook
a thing and so my mother sent me to ask for a handful
of embers and she will return them very soon."</p>

<p>"You little silly, you! Who ever heard of returning
a few embers?" cried she, as she took the tongs and
raked some into an old pot. "Here, tell your mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
to make up a good fire and cook you a nice stew. But
take care, Peterle, don't you let the wind get at them,
or it will blow the sparks up to the roof. There, go
now, in God's name!"</p>

<p>So gentle was she with me, who had so lightly played
away her loaf! It weighs upon my conscience to this
day.</p>

<p>When, at last, I got back to the house with my pot of
fire, I was greatly surprised to see blue smoke rising out
of the chimney.</p>

<p>"You're one to send to fetch death and not fire!"
cried mother, as I entered.</p>

<p>And she busied herself about the fire crackling in the
hearth and did not so much as look at me.</p>

<p>My coals were now hardly flickering and looked
wretched beside that fire. I put the pot down sadly in a
corner of the hearth and slunk away. I had been gone
much too long; then, by good fortune, Cousin Jok had
come home from the meadow, and he had a burning-glass,
which he held over a piece of tinder in the sun until
it caught. And so the sun which I had slandered had
stolen a march upon me and provided fire for the porridge
before I did. I was heartily ashamed of myself and, to
this day, am unable to look the benefactor straight in
the face.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I slunk into the paddock. There I saw Cousin Jok
squatting in his long grey, red-embroidered fur, with
his white head. And, when I drew nigh, I saw why he
was squatting here like that. The snow-white kid lay
in front of him, with its head and its feet outstretched
and Cousin Jok was stripping off its hide.</p>

<p>At that I burst into loud weeping. Cousin Jok stood
up, took me by the hand, and said:</p>

<p>"There it lies and looks at you!"</p>

<p>And the kid really was staring into my face with its
glassy eyes. And yet it was dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>"Peterle!" whispered my cousin, gravely. "Mother
sent the Knierutscher woman a loaf of bread."</p>

<p>"Yes," I sobbed, "and it ran away from me, right
down over the edge."</p>

<p>"Since you own up, laddie," said Cousin Jok, "I will
arrange things so that nothing happens to you. I have
told mother that a stone or something came rolling
down and killed the kid. (Somehow, I thought in my
own mind that Peterle was at the back of it!) That loaf
of bread came straight out of the air, down over the high
edge, passed me and hit the kid right on the head. The
poor little thing staggered and fell and was dead as a
mouse at once. However, don't be afraid, we'll keep to
the stone idea. I'll make things all right with the Knierutscher
woman too; and now be quiet, laddie, and don't
pull such dismal faces. To-night we'll eat the poor
beastie, and mother will cook us a horseradish-soup to
go with it."</p>

<p>In such wise died the little white kid. My brother
and sisters told me it had been killed by a naughty,
cruel stone.</p>

<p>To please me, mother added my coals to the fire on
the hearth, and before this fire the kid was roasted.
It was to have been a gift for Cousin Jok; and now he
was to have roast kid instead. But he invited all of us
to join him and gave us the best bits. I did not relish
mine at all.</p>

<p>The next morning, Jakoberle armed himself with a
cudgel, followed Cousin Jok with it into the lower meadow
and wanted to see the stone that killed the little kid.</p>

<p>"Child," said Cousin Jok, chewing hard at his pipe,
"it rolled further on and the water's running over it
now: it's down in the glen."</p>

<p>The dear, good old man! The stone that killed the
little kid was lying on my heart.</p>

Children of the World in the
Forest</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Far</span> more intelligent must he be, the peasant of the
isolated mountain farm, far more versatile and
capable than the villager, and infinitely more so than the
townsman&mdash;<em>must</em>, or he could not exist!</p>

<p>The townsman has an easy time of it: if he can write,
or keep accounts; if, for instance, he has the knack of
making leather, or keeps a grocer's shop; or even if he
speculates and applies himself to cutting off his coupons,
he has all that he requires; and all that a townsman
requires everyone who is a townsman knows.</p>

<p>The things which, in the towns, are produced by the
divided toil of thousands of heads, hands, and wheels, in
other words, the necessaries of life, the peasant in the
far-lying mountains must make for himself, in his narrow
circle, with his small, unaided means. He is a provider
of natural produce, manufacturer, middleman and consumer,
all in one. The bread which he eats comes from
the corn which he flung into the earth last year with his
own hand; the bacon which he enjoys on its bed of cabbage
is cut from the pig fattened with the turnips which
he has planted in his own ground. The shoe which he
wears is made of the cow-hide which he himself has
stripped from the animal's body and himself has tanned;
the wool that forms his coat he has shorn from his own
sheep, spun, woven and milled. The shirt on his back he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
saw last summer shimmering in the sunny fields in the
blue flax-blossom; and the milking-pail into which his
cow sends her milk streaming was, but a year ago, hiding
in a fir-trunk in his woods. And I could in like manner
string out a long list of matters in which the farmer must
be his own breeder, gardener, miller, baker, smith,
saddler, carpenter, weaver, wheelwright and so on. And
a household in which one and all of these trades are put
in practice need not even be a very large one: it is the
ordinary farmhouse in the mountain valleys to which
the world of exchange and barter has not yet fully made
its way.</p>

<p>Isn't it true, then, that such a peasant-farmer needs
to have a head on his shoulders? This head, again, is
of home production, and a good thing too; for the Jew
pedlar, who is always prepared to bring any requisite from
town for cash, could hardly be expected to supply that.</p>

<p>But nowadays this, like most things, is changing;
and, since gold and silver have taken to rolling to and
fro, in such a momentous fashion, between the houses
of town and country, the peasant no longer has the same
joy in his farm, where he must always be labouring for
others. Besides, he need not work out in the wilderness
nowadays; he can do much better, they tell him, on
rented land or in the factories; he sells or lets his property
and goes after money. And there at last you have the
stupid peasant!</p>

<p>I only speak of these things because my father's house,
concerning which I have something to tell, was one of
those farms in which we ourselves produced nearly everything
that we wanted. And yet, even at that time,
money played us a trick. My father was particularly
clever at tanning hides, at weaving, at grinding corn and
at pressing linseed-oil. In the last case, I assisted him to
brave purpose, as a boy of ten, by dipping a slice of white
bread into the oil that ran from the gutter of the press and
then transferring the bright yellow slice to my mouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>One day, while we were thus engaged, Clements, the
timber-merchant, walked into the pressing-room. He
had once been forest-ranger at Alpel; but he had made
such a huge amount of money in the timber-trade that
he lost all interest in our mountains and went down
into the broad Mürzthal, where he displayed a restless
activity in acquiring more and yet more money. He had
grown quite lean at this unedifying occupation; but
otherwise he continued in fairly good fettle.</p>

<p>Well, when Clements saw the oil bubbling in the
wooden pail, he asked, was the cider sweet?</p>

<p>My father invited him to taste it; but, when Clements
lifted the pail bodily and took a draught from it, he fell
back as though someone had struck him in the face and
lost no time in spitting out what he had swallowed.</p>

<p>"It can't hurt you," said my father, to console him.
"It is pure linseed oil."</p>

<p>"Forest-farmer," said Clements, gradually recovering
himself, "here I am, bringing all sorts of good things to
your house; and this is the way you treat me!"</p>

<p>"You're the first I ever met that did not like flax-wine,"
replied my father. "It's just like a wine, so golden and
clear. And you couldn't find anything better for one's
precious health. I am in the doctor's debt to the price
of a couple of oxen; and even then I should be under
the sod to-day if Our Father in Heaven had not made
linseed-oil to grow."</p>

<p>"And, as you, forest-farmer, are still, thank God,
above the sod," drawled Clements, "you'll be needing
money, I'm thinking. Look, it's your guardian angel's
brought me here: I'm bringing you some."</p>

<p>"Oh, my gracious!" replied my father, leaning his
whole weight upon the lever, so that the oil-cake in the
press had to yield its last drains, which, however, were
received into a separate little pot, for these dregs are
not quite so clear and mild as the first stream. "Oh,
my gracious!" said he. "I could do with the money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
well enough; but you can just take it away again: I
know what you want for it. You want the six old fir-trees
that stand outside my house. Things are a sight
worse with me than they were a year ago, when you
came and asked to buy the trees, but I have no other
answer for you than I gave you then: the six trees outside
the house are a memory of the old days; and, if I
had to sell field and meadow and the cattle in the stable,
those trees shall stay where they are; and, if they have
to lay me in the grave without a coffin, those old trees
shall stay where they are until God's lightning cracks
them or the storm fells them."</p>

<p>The last words were spoken with violence; and, with
that, the last drop of oil left the press.</p>

<p>But Clements said:</p>

<p>"Forest-farmer, you shall not sell a field, nor a head
of cattle from your stable; you shall have a coffin of good
white ash-wood: God grant that you may not need it
for a long time to come! You shall have good days yet
in this world. You shall not sell the old fir-trees, but
you shall sell the larch in your wood that are fit for
felling. Have you your pocket-book on you? If so,
just open it."</p>

<p>I got a fright, when I saw the figure on the bank-note
which the tempter had now drawn from his leather case
and which, holding it between his finger-tips, he sent
fluttering to and fro, like a little flag, before my father's
blinking eyes. Misfortune had cleared the way in our
house for the timber-merchant: we were no longer able
to get all we wanted for our ten heads and stomachs out
of that eighty yoke of mountain land; the doctor was
sending us letters which I could not read soft and low
enough to make them bearable to my father:</p>

<p>"The forest-farmer is hereby summoned within fourteen
days to &hellip; failing which&hellip;."</p>

<p>"As my patience is at last exhausted, I have placed
the matter in the hands of the imperial and royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
courts, and if, within eight days &hellip; execution and
distraint&hellip;."</p>

<p>Those were more or less the first sentences which I was
given to read in our dear High-German language. And
there was a certain book, too, with its "date of debt"
and "date of payment," which gave me an idea of the
force that lies concealed in the language of Schiller and
Goethe.</p>

<p>It was a real live "hundred" which the timber-merchant
held by the corner between his two fingers.
Did not a chill shudder, at that moment, go over the
tops of the larches that were dotted here and there in
the pine-woods outside, I wonder? Nor any anxious
foreboding trouble the hearts of the little birds that had
built their nests there?</p>

<p>My father did not put out his hand for the money,
but neither did he hide it in his pocket; he did not busy
it with the lever of the oil-press; he just kept it, half-open,
as nature had bent it, on his knee, while he sat
exhausted with his labour. Clements dropped the rare
bit of paper into it; then the lank fingers closed softly&mdash;instinctively&mdash;and
held it tight.</p>

<p>The larch were sold.</p>

<p>"I have only one condition to make," said the timber-merchant,
when he saw that the poor small farmer lay
duly under the spell of the money. "I shall have the
trees felled late in the autumn, when the snow comes.
You will be astonished, forest-farmer, when I tell you
that the emperor will ride over your larch-trees! Yes,
yes, we shall use them for building the railway. My
condition is that my wood-cutters shall be allowed to
cook their meals and sleep in your house as long as they
are working in the woods."</p>

<p>"Why not?" said father. "That'll be all right, if
it's good enough for them under my roof."</p>

<p>What mischief those good-natured words brought
down upon our peaceful forest home!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>Clements went away happy and contented, after presenting
me with a bright new groschen for myself. I
remember being surprised at this: it was obviously for
us to be contented, seeing that we had the money! Father
took his up to the loft and hid it in the clothes-press:
it was very soon to come out again. Then the days
passed, as usual, and the larch stood in the woods and
rocked their long branches in the wind, as usual, and
got ready their twigs for next spring, as usual.</p>

<p>"They don't know how soon they are to die!" my
father said to me once, as we were coming from the
meadow through the woods.</p>

<p>But I comforted myself with the hope that Clements
the timber-merchant, who lived out in the merry Mürzthal
and never came back to our neighbourhood at all, would
forget all about the larch. My mother, to whom I confided
this view, said sharply:</p>

<p>"Oh, child, that fellow forgets about his soul, but he'll
never forget the larches!"</p>

<p>And, one day, when the earth had frozen hard and the
moss cracked and broke underfoot, we heard the rasping
of the saw in the woods. When we looked across the
brown tops of the firs, we saw the yellow spire of a tall
larch-tree soar high above them. The rasping of the
saw died away, the blows of the axe rang out; then
slowly the spire bent over, dipped; and thunder echoed
through the forest.</p>

<p>That evening the wood-cutters came to our house.
There were only two of them; and, at first sight, we were
all pleased with them. One of them was already well on
in years and had a long red beard, a bald pate and a
sharp, crooked nose. The man's little eyes looked smaller
still because the red eyelashes and eyebrows were hardly
visible against the colour of his skin; but the eyes were
full of fun and devilment. The other was quite twenty
years or so younger, had a little brown beard, but otherwise
was rather pale and thin in the face. Anyone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
however, seeing his powerful neck and his broad chest
would take him to be much more of a wood-cutter than
the red one, who only looked such a warrior because of
his beard, but, in other respects, was much slighter in
build than the pale one. Both wore stiff leather aprons
and smelt of rosin and shavings.</p>

<p>Our cooking was soon done; so mother left the hearth
to them. And, upon my word, they knew how to make
use of it! What they cooked was not the regular wood-cutter's
game, such as stray foxes, sparrows and such-like
dumplings as are prepared with flour and fat, but
real meat and bacon and grill; and it all simmered and
frizzled in the pans until our stomachs, which had to be
satisfied with bread-soup and potatoes, were driven
frantic. But the red one tore off a whole piece of bacon
for us to taste. They had a wooden jar with them, wound
round with straw, out of which one and the other took
long draughts. The red one invited my father to try
their wine. He did; and his experience was worse than
that of Clements with the linseed-oil: the jar contained
that hellish stuff, brandy.</p>

<p>The wood-cutters now feasted in our house day after
day. We children lost all liking for our daily food, at the
sight of luxury and abundance. We became discontented;
and our household, consisting of two half-grown servant-girls
and a half-blind woman, heaved many a deep sigh.
But the red one knew how to amuse us. He talked of
towns and other countries; for the two men had been
about a good deal and had worked in large factories.
Then he regaled us with funny stories and tricks; in the
early days also with riddles and droll plays upon words, at
which the maids tittered a good deal, while father and
mother sat silent and I did not rightly know what to
make of it all. Then came songs, in which, to the great
delight of our household, country courtship in all its
forms found full expression. When this began, it was
high time for us children to go to bed; but our straw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
bundles happened to be in the very room in which these
merry things were going on. True, we closed our eyes,
and I really had the firm intention to go to sleep; but
my ears remained open, and the tighter I closed my eyes,
the more I saw in my mind's eye.</p>

<p>The pale wood-cutter was quiet and proper in his behaviour
and did not remain so long in the parlour, but
always went betimes to his sleeping-place, which was outside
in the hay-loft. But even the girls could not follow
this decent example: they let the red one go on and
were wholly absorbed in his chattering. My father once
observed to the red fellow that the younger was more
serious than the old one, whereupon the red one asked
if the farmer disliked jolly songs: in that case, he would
be pious and pray. And he began to recite comic sentences
in the tone of the Lord's Prayer; got on to the
hearth and, mimicking the preaching of a Capuchin,
mocked at the holy apostles, martyrs, and virgins, until
my mother went to my father with uplifted hands.</p>

<p>"I do beg and beseech you, Lenzel&mdash;throw that godless
being out of the door, or I shall have to do it myself!"</p>

<p>"Do it yourself, little woman!" cried the red man and
jumped off the hearthstone and tried to catch hold of
mother and fondle her.</p>

<p>This was something unheard of. That this should
suddenly happen in our house, where, year in, year out,
no unseemly word was ever spoken! My father was
downright paralysed with astonishment; but my mother
seized the frivolous wood-cutter by the arm and cried:</p>

<p>"Now you get out of this, foul-mouth, and never enter
my house again!"</p>

<p>The wood-cutter refused to budge an inch.</p>

<p>"If forest-farmer folk are so pious," he continued, still
in his preaching tone, "as to forget what they have
promised our employer, I shan't leave this roof for all
that. Women and wet rags shan't drive me out."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>"Perhaps men and dry logs will!" cried my father.
And with a swiftness and determination which I had
never before beheld in this mild-mannered man, he
snatched a log of wood from the stack. The red one
made a furious rush at his arms; and they wrestled.
Mother tried to protect father; my brothers and sisters
in their straw set up a cry of murder; I flew to the door,
with nothing on me but my shirt, and called to the
maids, who were already sleeping peacefully in their
beds, to come and help. The blind one was the first to
come hobbling safely across the yard, while one of the
two who had the use of their eyes stumbled over the
pigs' trough. And the youngest girl, terrified by my
cries and the uproar in the house, came clattering down
the step-ladder that led from the hay-loft to the yard.
Without considering, at the time, the far-reaching effects
of this last incident, I rushed back into the house, where
the two men were engaged in a violent struggle, panting
and groaning and going from one wall of the room to
the other. The wood-cutter's long beard was flung in wild
strands around my father's head; but father seemed to
be gaining the upper hand; then came the younger
wood-cutter, clad, it is true, in nothing but his shirt and
his blue drawers, but with the full weight of his body.
The women did what is their office on such occasions:
they wrung their hands and wailed. Only, my mother,
when she saw that all was lost, snatched a blazing fire-brand
from the hearth.</p>

<p>"I'll drive you out, you ruffians, that I do know!" she
cried and flew, with the brand, to the wooden inner wall.</p>

<p>"The fury means to set fire to us! And to the house
with us!" yelled the wood-cutters and rushed out at
the door, through the curling smoke.</p>

<p>We were rid of the nasty fellows, but the flames were
leaping merrily along the wall. In hot haste, we succeeded&mdash;I
no longer remember by what means&mdash;in
smothering the fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>That evening&mdash;the most terrible in my life&mdash;passed
into a still and fearsome night. We
had barred and bolted the door of the house;
and, when we put out the rushlight, father took a
last look at the window, to see if they were still
outside.</p>

<p>It remained quiet; and not till the next morning did
the young wood-cutter come to fetch his tools and his
mate's. Then they built themselves a hut in the woods
out of planks and bark; and here they lived half through
the winter, until they had finished their work on the
larch-trunks.</p>

<p>We felt convinced, however, that they must be plotting
some mischief against us, whereupon the youngest of the
maids remarked, with an air of great wisdom, that it
might be best always to keep on good terms with that
kind of people.</p>

<p>"It's easy for you to talk, wench," retorted my father.
"What do you know?"</p>

<p>After that &hellip; she said no more.</p>

<p>I had a fresh fright at that time. Prompted by curiosity
to see the godless fellows once more and to spy out
whether the devil, in the guise of a wood-cutter, was
helping them with their work, I peeped one day from
the forest path and through the thicket at their
work-place. Then I saw that they were making
coffins.</p>

<p>I announced the fact at home and caused the greatest
excitement in consequence.</p>

<p>"As I said, they have some fresh thing in their minds!"
said my mother.</p>

<p>Father suggested:</p>

<p>"Boy, you have been dreaming again, in broad daylight.
Still, I will go and see."</p>

<p>We went into the woods. My father peered through
the thicket at the wood-cutters; and then I saw him
turn pale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>"You half-wit!"<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8" href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> he said; and then he groaned.
"They're burying every peasant of us at Alpel!"</p>

<p>The coffins were stacked in great piles; and the men
were still chopping and trimming new ones with their
axes. We rushed away to inform the local magistrate,
who, at that time, lived on the mountain on the other
side of the Engthal, and tell him what we had seen.
On the road to his house we met Michel the carpenter,
to whom my father said that he had better have all his
knives and choppers ready, for it looked as if we were in
for bad times. The strangers who were working in his
wood did nothing but make coffins.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Michel, "I've noticed that too: it's a
good thing the coffins are not hollow!"</p>

<p>And the man of experience told us of the shape of the
railway-sleepers, which were usually cut from the block
in pairs, before being sawn asunder, and which, with
their six corners, looked not unlike a coffin.</p>

<p>We turned back then and there, and as we went along
the edge of the field, where the grass was nice and smooth,
my father said to me:</p>

<p>"This gives us a good chance of laughing at ourselves,
lest others should. That's the way things go: when
we've fallen out with a man, we put down everything
that's bad to him and are as blind as if Satan had stuck
his horns into our eyes. When all is said, even those
two wood-cutters are not so black as they appear to be.
Still, I shall be glad when they have cleared out. And
this much I do know: Clements buys no more larch of
me."</p>

<p>"Because you have none left," was my wise comment
on that.</p>

<p>Father did not seem to hear.</p>

<p>The wood-cutters went at last and the larch-wood
sleepers with them. The red-brown stumps remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
behind; and in their pores stood bright drops of
rosin.</p>

<p>"It shows that they were not Christians," I remember
my father saying, "that they did not cut a cross in a
single stump."</p>

<p>For, at that time, it was still the custom, in the forest,
for the wood-cutters to carve a little cross with the axe
into each stump as soon as the tree had fallen. Why, I
was never quite able to discover: it was probably for
the same reason that makes the blacksmith give two
taps with his hammer on the anvil, after the red-hot
iron is removed. These things are intended to thwart
the devil, who, as everybody knows, is never idle and
interferes in all the works of man.</p>

<p>My father, whose whole life was bound up with the
cross, went afterwards and cut crosses in the larch-stumps.
And so things in the forest were once more in
order and peaceful, as they used to be.</p>

<p>And that is the story of the strange wood-cutters, the
children of the world, who had penetrated into our
far-away forest-nook like the first wave of the turbulent
sea of the world. How small this wave was and what an
amount of unrest, discontent, and vexation was washed
up with it! Gradually, the strange elements were forgotten:
even mother ended by overcoming her indignation.
Only our little serving-maid remained restless and
wistful, even after the wave had flowed back again, and
her eyes were often red with crying.</p>

How Meisensepp Died</h2>


<p class="cap3"><span class="upper">At</span> home we had a book called <cite>The Lives of Jesus Christ,
Our Lady, and of many of God's Saints: a spiritual
treasure by Peter Cochem</cite>. It was an old book, the leaves
were grey, and each chapter began with wonderful big
letters in black and red. The wooden cover was worm-eaten
in many places, and a mouse had nibbled away one
of the leathern flaps. Since my grandfather's death there
was nobody in our house who could have read it; no
wonder, then, that these creatures had taken possession of
it, and thus gained their bodily sustenance from the spiritual
treasure. Then came I, the little book-worm, chasing
the little beasts out of the book and devouring it myself
instead. I read out of it daily to the members of our
household. The younger farm-lads and girls did not care
much for this new custom, for they dared not joke and
yodel during the reading; the older people, however,
being rather more God-fearing, listened devoutly and
said, "It's just as if the parson were preaching; so
solemnly done and with such a loud voice!"</p>

<p>I got quite a reputation as an able reader, and was
much sought after. Whenever anybody in the neighbourhood
lay ill or dying, or was even dead already, and
there was watch being kept by the corpse during the
night, my father was asked to let me go and read. On
such occasions I took the weighty book under my arm
and set off. It was hard work carrying it, for at that
time I was but a little shrimp of a fellow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>Once, late at night, when I was already asleep in the
sweet-scented hay-loft where I sometimes had my bed
in summer-time, I was awakened by one of our men
tugging at my coverlet. "You must get up quickly,
Peter, get up! Meisensepp has sent his daughter, and
begs that you'll come and read to him&mdash;he's dying. Get
up!"</p>

<p>Of course, I got up, dressed myself hastily, took the
book, and went with the girl from our house up across
the heath and through the forest. Meisensepp's hut stood
quite alone in the midst of the forest.</p>

<p>Meisensepp had been gamekeeper and woodward in his
younger years; latterly he occupied himself mostly with
sharpening saws for the wood-cutters. Then suddenly
this severe illness overtook him.</p>

<p>While the girl and I were going through the wilderness
in the still, starlit night neither of us spoke a word.
Silently we went on together. Only once she whispered,
"Let me have the book, Peter; I'll carry it for you."</p>

<p>"You couldn't do it," I answered; "you're even
smaller than me."</p>

<p>After a two hours' tramp the girl said, "There's the
light."</p>

<p>We saw a faint gleam coming from the window of
Meisensepp's house. Going nearer, we met the priest who
had administered the Last Sacrament to the dying man.</p>

<p>"Father, is he going to get well?" asked the girl,
fearfully.</p>

<p>"He is not so very old," said the priest. "God's will
be done, children; God's will be done."</p>

<p>And he went on, while we went into the house.</p>

<p>It was small, and, after the manner of forest huts,
living-room and bedroom were all one with the kitchen.
On the hearth in an iron holder a pine-torch was burning
which veiled the ceiling in a cloud of smoke. Near by, on
a bundle of straw, two little boys lay sleeping. I knew
them well, for we had often gathered mushrooms and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
berries together in the woods and lost our herds while
doing it: they were a few years younger than I. By the
wall of the stove sat Sepp's wife, giving the breast to the
baby and looking with wide-open eyes into the flame of
the pine-torch; and behind the stove, on the only bed
in the house, lay the sick man. He was sleeping; his
face was wasted, the greyish hair and the beard round
the chin had been cut short, which made the whole head
appear smaller to me than formerly when I had seen
Sepp on the way to church. Through his pale, half-open
lips fluttered the broken breathing.</p>

<p>On our entrance his wife got up gently, made some
apology for having had me disturbed in my sleep, and
invited me to sit down and eat what the priest had left
of a dish of eggs which still stood on the table.</p>

<p>And so, seated on the chair that was still warm from
the holy man's sitting, I was soon actually eating with
the same fork which he had carried to his mouth!</p>

<p>"Now he's sleeping fairly well," whispered the woman,
indicating the sick man. "A little while ago he was
constantly pulling threads from the coverlet."</p>

<p>I knew it was looked upon as a bad omen when a sick
person pulled at and dug into the coverlet: "He's digging
his grave," they say with us. I therefore answered,
"Yes, that's what my father did, too, when he had
typhoid fever; still, he got well again."</p>

<p>"I think so, too," she said; "and the priest was
saying the same thing. I am so glad my Sepp has
always gone to confession so regular, and I feel quite
hopeful about his getting well again. Only," she added
very low, "the light keeps flickering to and fro the
whole time."</p>

<p>According to popular belief, when the light flickers,
it is an omen that someone's candle is burning low in
the socket. I believed in this sign myself, but to reassure
the poor woman I said, "There's such a draught coming
through the window, I can feel it too." She laid the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
sleeping baby upon the straw&mdash;the girl who had fetched
me had already gone to rest there&mdash;and we stopped the
cracks of the window with tow.</p>

<p>Then the woman said, "You'll stay with me overnight,
won't you, Peter? I shouldn't know how to get
along otherwise; and when he awakes you will read
to us? I am sure you'll do us this kindness, won't
you?"</p>

<p>I opened the book and looked for a suitable piece, but
Father Cochem has not written much that would be of
consolation to poor suffering mankind. Father Cochem's
opinion is that God is infinitely just and that men are
unutterably bad, and nine-tenths of them are bound
straight for hell.</p>

<p>Maybe it is so, I used to think to myself; but even
if it is one ought not to say so, because people would
only worry, and for the rest would most likely remain as
bad as ever. If they had wanted to mend, they would
have done so long ago.</p>

<p>Terrifying thoughts went like a hissing adder through
Cochem's book. Whenever I had to do with indifferent
people, who only listened to me on account of my fine
loud preaching voice, I thundered forth all the horrors
and the eternal damnation of mankind with real pleasure;
but when by a sick-bed I used to exert my imagination
to the utmost while reading out of the book, in order to
soften the hard sayings, to moderate the hideous representations
of the Four Last Things, and to give a friendlier
tone to the whole thought of the zealous Father.</p>

<p>And now again I planned how, while apparently reading
from the book, I would speak to Meisensepp words
from another Book about poverty, patience, and love
towards our fellows, and how the true imitation of Christ
consisted in the practice of these, and how&mdash;when the
last hour should strike&mdash;this would lead us by way of a
gentle death right into heaven.</p>

<p>At last Sepp awoke. He turned his head, looked at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
his wife and sleeping children, then, seeing me, he said
in a loud, clear voice, "So you've come, Peter? God
reward you for it! But we shall hardly have time for
reading to-day. Anne, please wake the children up."</p>

<p>The woman shuddered, her hand went to her heart, but
she said quietly, "Are you worse again, Seppel? You've
been sleeping so nicely."</p>

<p>He saw at once that her calmness was not genuine.</p>

<p>"Don't you fret, wife," he said, "it must be so in this
world. Wake the children up now, but gently, so that
you don't scare them."</p>

<p>The poor woman went to the bed of straw, and with
trembling hand shook the bundle, and the little ones
started up only half awake.</p>

<p>"Anne, I beg you don't pull the children about so,"
the sick man reproached her, with a weaker voice, "and let
little Martha sleep, she doesn't understand things yet."</p>

<p>I remained seated by the table, and my heart burned
within me. The little family gathered round the bed,
sobbing aloud.</p>

<p>"Quietly now," said Sepp to the children; "mother
will let you sleep all the longer to-morrow morning.
Josefa, draw the shirt together over your breast or you
will get cold.&mdash;Now then, children, you must always be
brave and good and obedient to your mother, and when
you are grown up you must stand by her and don't leave
her. All my days I've toiled and moiled, but for all that
I've nothing else to leave you beyond this house, with the
little garden and the ridge-acre with the stacks. If you
want to divide it up, do so in a brotherly way; but it is
better to keep the little property together, and keep the
home going, somehow, and till the ground. Beyond that
I make no will. I love you all alike. Don't forget me, and
now and then say an Our Father for me. And you four
boys, I beg from my very heart, don't start poaching&mdash;it
leads to no good. Give me your hand on it. There, that's
right! If one of you would like to learn saw-sharpening&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
I have earned many a penny with it and the tools are all
there. And then, as you know already, if you plant
potatoes on the ridge-acre, you must do so in May. It's
quite true, what my father always used to say, 'Of
potatoes it is said: "Plant me in April, I come when I
will; plant me in May, I'm there in a day."' Bear that
saying in mind! There, now go to bed again, or you will
catch cold; always take care of your health; health is
everything. Go to sleep, children."</p>

<p>The sick man became silent and fell to plucking at his
covering again.</p>

<p>Turning to me the woman whispered, "I don't like it,
he's talking too much." When a very sick person becomes
suddenly talkative that too is looked upon as a bad
omen with us.</p>

<p>Then he lay quite exhausted. The woman lit a death-taper.</p>

<p>"Not yet, Anne, not yet," he murmured, "a little
later; but give me a drop of water, will you?"</p>

<p>After drinking he said, "Ah, fresh water is a good
thing after all! Take good care of the well. Yes, and
don't let me forget, the black breeches and the blue jacket&mdash;you
know&mdash;and outside behind the door, where the saws
hang, there leans the planing board; lay it across the
grindstone and the bench&mdash;it will serve for the three days.
To-morrow early, when Woodman Josel comes, he'll help
to lay me out. But mind that the cat isn't about; cats
are attracted and know at once when there is a corpse
anywhere. It's all arranged what they'll do with me down
at the Parish Church.&mdash;My brown coat and the big hat,
give them to the poor. And to Peter you must give something
because of his coming up here. Perhaps he will
be good enough to read to-morrow. It will be a fine
day to-morrow, but don't go far from home, for fear an
accident might happen, when there's candles left burning
in the entrance. Later on, Anne, look in the bedstraw and
you will find an old stocking with a few gold pieces in it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>"Seppel, don't exert yourself with talking so much,"
sobbed the wife.</p>

<p>"Well, well, Anne&mdash;but I must tell you everything.
We'll not be much longer together now. We have had
twenty years, Anne. You have been everything to me;
no one can repay you for what you have been to me. I
shall never forget it, not in death, nor in heaven neither.
I am only glad that in my last hour I am still able to talk
to you, and that I am clear in my head to the last."</p>

<p>"Don't fret yourself, Seppel," murmured the wife,
bending over him.</p>

<p>"No," he answered quietly, "with me it's just as it was
with my father: content in life, content in death. You
be the same, and don't take it too much to heart. Even
though each of us must go as we came, alone, still we
belong to each other and I shall keep you a place in
heaven, Anne, close by my side. Only, for God's sake,
bring the children up well."</p>

<p>The children lay quiet. It was very still, and it seemed
to me as if, somewhere in the room, I could hear a slight
whirring and humming.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Seppel called out, "Now, Anne, light the
candle, quick!"</p>

<p>The woman ran about the room looking for matches,
and yet the torch was still burning. "Now he is going
to die!" she moaned.</p>

<p>When at last the red wax-taper was alight, and she had
given it him and he held it clasped with both his hands,
and she had taken the vessel of holy water from the shelf,
she became apparently quite calm and prayed aloud:
"Jesus, Mary, help him! Oh, Saints of God, stand by
him in his direst need, do not let his soul be lost! Jesus,
I pray by Thy holiest suffering! Mary, I call upon Thy
seven Sacred Dolours! And Thou, his guardian angel,
when the soul must quit the body, lead it at last to
heavenly joy!"</p>

<p>And she prayed long. She neither sobbed nor cried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
now; not a single tear stood in her eye, she was wholly
the devout petitioner and intercessor.</p>

<p>At length she became silent, bent over her husband's
face, watched his weak breathing and whispered, "God
be with you, Seppel; greet my parents for me and all
our kinsfolk there in Eternity. God bless and keep you,
my dearest man! May the holy angels attend you, and
the Lord Jesus in His mercy await you at the heavenly
door."</p>

<p>Perhaps he no longer heard her. His pale, half-open
lips gave no answer. His eyes stared at the ceiling. The
wax candle, held upright in the folded hands, was burning;
it did not flicker. The flame was still and bright as a
snow-white bud, his breath moved it no more.</p>

<p>"Now it's over&mdash;he's dead and gone from me!" cried
his wife in a shrill, heartrending voice; then sank down
upon a stool and began to weep bitterly. The children,
now again wakened, wept with her, all except the baby,
who was smiling.</p>

<p>The hour weighed upon us heavy as a stone. At last
the poor woman&mdash;the widow&mdash;rose, dried her tears and
laid two fingers on the eyes of the dead. The wax candle
burned until the morning dawned.</p>

<p>A messenger had passed through the forest. Then
came the Woodman Josel. He sprinkled the dead with
holy water, murmuring, "So they go, one after the other."</p>

<p>Then they dressed Meisensepp out in his best clothes,
carried him into the porch, and laid him on the board.</p>

<p>I left the book on the table for the vigil of the following
nights at which I had promised the poor woman to read.
When I was ready to go, she brought a green hat on which
was fastened a spreading "Gemsbart."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9" href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>"Will you take the hat with you for your father?" she
asked; "my Seppel has always been so fond of your
father. The Gemsbart you may keep yourself as a remembrance.
Say an Our Father for him now and then."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>I uttered my thanks and cast one more timid look at
the bier. There lay Sepp stretched at full length, and his
hands folded across his breast. And I went away down
through the forest. How bright and fresh with dew, how
full of the song of birds, full of the scent of flowers&mdash;how
full of life the forest was! And in the hut, stretched on the
bier, lay a dead man.</p>

<p>I can never forget that night and that morning&mdash;that
death amidst the forest's infinite source of life.</p>

<p>To this day I keep the Gemsbart in memory of Meisensepp.
And whenever a desire for the pleasures of this
world gets hold of me, or when doubts of God's grace to
man, or fear of my own possibly far-off, possibly quite
near end assail me, I just stick Sepp's Gemsbart in my hat.</p>

The Corpus Christi Altar</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">When</span> the triumphant Saviour passes through the
village in the shape of bread, they greet Him with
palms. The palm of the alps is the birch. Even as the
little fir-trees are doomed to lose their lives at Christmas-time,
so do the birches at Corpus Christi. They are
dragged to the village by the hundred, on great drays,
and planted in rows on both sides of the streets through
which the procession is intended to go. And, as they
stand there in the fresh-turned earth, with their graceful
branches rustling in the soft wind, it is as though they
were still leading the young and happy lives of their
brothers and sisters in the woods. And no one notices
that the trunk stands in the earth without its roots,
chopped off by the axe, that the sap no longer courses
through its veins, that, in a few days, the pretty little
notched and heart-shaped leaves will turn yellow; nor
does the caterpillar on a yielding branch, as it dreams of
its coming butterfly existence, suspect that it is rocking
upon a corpse.</p>

<p>Life is fulfilled: lo, the Lord cometh.</p>

<p>At the Corpus Christi procession, the gospels are read
in the open air at four different spots. For this purpose,
the people set up four altars, so that "the Lord God may
rest on His journey." By ancient custom, it falls to him
upon whose ground the altar is to stand to erect this
altar. Its several parts, all nicely carved and painted,
have rested during the year in a dark corner of the loft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
and are now brought forth, cleansed of their dust and cobwebs
and put together in the open. The result is often
a noble building of the chapel order, with altar-table,
tabernacle, worshipping angels, candlesticks and all.
Farm-labourers, who but yesterday were digging manure,
to-day prove themselves accomplished architects, building
the altar before the sun-down and surrounding it with
a little wood of birch or larch. The head of the house
places all the images of the saints which he possesses on
the altar, or fastens them high up on the pillars. The
farmer's wife brings gaudy pots of crimson peonies to
adorn the altar; and the little girls strew flowers and
rose-leaves as a carpet for the steps.</p>

<p>The bells begin to ring, the mortars boom, music swells
far and wide over the roofs, lights burn in every window;
and the time has come for the farmer to light the candles
on his altar too. Soon the first pennants come in sight,
the hum is heard of the men's prayers and the echo of the
women's singing; and the long lines of children approach,
the girls in white, carrying gaily-coloured banners
above their heads. Finally, the band, with shrill trumpets
and rumbling drums, and then the <i>baldachino</i>, the
red canopy upheld by four men, and, under it, surrounded
by ministrants and acolytes, the priest, carrying
the gleaming monstrance high before his face.</p>

<p>The monstrance, as we all know, is the house in which
the Host resides surrounded by a wreath of golden rays,
resting on a crescent-shaped holder and protected by a
crystal glass.</p>

<p>The most important factor in this procession is faith;
and that is present in abundance. They worship not the
bread, but the symbolic mystery in whose lap rests our
eternal destiny. It is really incorrect to speak of the
worship of images, or of the idolatry of the heathen:
they all mean one and the same thing, the symbolic
divine mystery which each represents to himself after
his own fashion and feels according to his nature. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
the power to transfer the intangible, endless mystery to
a substance which our senses can apprehend and thus to
enter into more intimate relations with it: that power is
the gift of faith.</p>

<p>The files of people reach the open-air altar and the
foremost have to pass along until the priest arrives at
the spot. When there, he places the Sacrament in the
tabernacle and reads some verses from one of the four
gospels. Then, to the booming of the cannon, he lifts the
monstrance, turns with it to the four points of the compass
and blesses the meadows, the fields and the air, that the
summer may be fruitful and no storm destroy the husbandman's
labour. And the procession moves on.</p>

<p>This is in the larger villages. In the small mountain
districts, the feast is celebrated more simply, but no less
solemnly. As, in such places, all the lanes and streets are
formed of live trees and shrubs, there is no need to set
up birches, except at the wayside crucifixes, where they
keep holy guard, one on the right and one on the left.
As the people of small places have not four altars to erect,
there is a small, portable altar, a little four-legged table
with a white cloth to cover it and a tabernacle with
angels painted on a blue ground kneeling before the
"Holy Name." Above this is a little canopy with gold
tassels. Behind are straps by means of which a boy can
take the altar on his back and carry it, during the procession,
from one gospel-place to the other.</p>

<p>They have one of these little altars at Kathrein am
Hauenstein. Should you care to see it, it stands, in
summer, in the church, in front of the great picture of
the Fourteen Helpers.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10" href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> It has stood there as long as I
can remember; and, in my young days, it was the duty
and the privilege of Kaunigl, him with the hare-lip, to carry
it from gospel-place to gospel-place. As soon as one gospel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
was read and the procession starting on its way again,
he strapped the altar to his back, took the candlesticks
and the hassock in his hands and hurried over the hill
by the short cut through the woods, so as to obtain a
lead and set up the altar in the next place. He would fix
a stone or two under the feet of the little table to prevent
any rocking, put the hassock in position and light the
candles; and, by that time, the first banner was once
more in sight.</p>

<p>Now it happened, one day, that this was the occasion of
my being mixed up in a business that threatened the
destruction of my immortal soul. I had just reached the
age when nobody knows how a young scamp is going to
turn out. He may develop into a more or less decent
fellow, or else into a lout of the first water: who can tell?
None but God really; and even He leaves the choice to
the lanky, pale-faced lad himself. On the day in question,
I had either overslept myself in my forest home
or had more trouble than usual in getting my lace-boots
on; or perhaps breakfast was not ready in time.
Anyhow, by the time I reached Kathrein church, everything
was in full swing, with the red banners waving
and the candles twinkling between the trees. I stole
round to the back, for I was mortally ashamed to do the
right thing and simply go straight up to the procession
and mix with the people. Here again God left the
choice to me, to join the worshippers or slink away
through the bushes like a gaol-bird. I slunk like a gaol-bird
through the bushes and there met Kaunigl with
the altar. He at once asked me to help him carry it.
This suited me perfectly, for it justified the roundabout
road which I had taken. I relieved Kaunigl of the
hassock and candlesticks; and we hurried through the
young trees up to the Föhrenriegel, behind the church,
where the last gospel was to be read. We worked together
loyally; and soon the little altar was fixed against
the rock, with the candles burning upon it. The procession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
was not yet in sight, for it had taken a longer road
through the green fields; but this Kaunigl boy was not
the fellow to let time slip by and be wasted. He thrust
his hand in his trousers-pocket, produced a pack of cards
and flung it on the altar so that the candles flickered
before the fluttering bits of pasteboard. Silently, as
though what he was doing were a matter of course, he
dealt himself and me a hand at <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Brandel</i>. It was not the
first time that he and I had "taken each other on"; so
I picked up the cards and we played a strict game on the
Corpus Christi altar, by the light of the wax candles
burning solemnly. There was time for a second "bout";
and then, while Kaunigl was dealing the cards again, the
men at the head of the procession appeared round the
corner, praying aloud with heads uncovered. No cat
could have pounced upon nimble mouse quicker than
Kaunigl gathered up those cards and shoved them in his
pocket. Then we took up our positions on either side,
in all innocence, and pulled off our caps.</p>

<p>Soon the musicians hove in sight: Eggbauer with the
bugle-horn, his son with the first trumpet, Naz the tailor
(who afterwards became my master) with the second,
Erhard's boy with the clarionet, Zenz the smith with
the kettle-drum, while long-nosed Franz carried the big
drum on his back, to be pounded with might and main
by the Haustein innkeeper. Ferdl the huntsman handled
the "tinklers."</p>

<p>Behind this loud music came the <i>baldachino</i>. The old
white-haired parish priest carried the Most Holy high in
front of him and held his head bowed low, partly in
veneration and partly because age had already greatly
bent his neck. He walked up to the little altar to place
the monstrance on it. He was on the point of doing so
when suddenly he stopped and stood for a moment with
a stare upon his face. He had caught sight of the ten of
clubs peeping from between the folds of the white altar-cloth!
The confounded card had remained there hidden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
and unperceived! To decorate the Corpus Christi altar
with "green" of this kind<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11" href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> could hardly seem correct
in the eyes of his reverence. Without a word, without a
sign of displeasure, he turned to the rock and placed the
monstrance on a projecting stone.</p>

<p>Only a very few people had realised why this was done.
The gospel was read and the benediction given without
further incident, but I peeped through the hazel-bushes
and saw that the old priest was white to the lips. Had he
shown anger at his discovery on the altar, had he stormed
and ordered the culprit to be taken by the ears, I should
have thought it no more than just; but his humble
silence, his look of sorrow, and the fact that he had to
place the Saviour, rendered homeless by that sacrilegious
game at cards, upon the bare rock: these were things
that cut into me as with a knife. He cannot have
known who the accomplice was, but he could easily
have found out by my conscience-stricken face, however
much it might try to hide itself behind the hazel-bushes.</p>

<p>Afterwards, when high mass began in church, Kaunigl
pulled me by the skirt of my jacket and invited me to
climb into the tower with him, where we could toll the
bell at the Sanctus and the elevation and play cards in
between. He had recovered possession of the ten of
clubs. True, I did not accept; but I remained lost, for
all that. From that day forward I no longer ventured
into the confessional. Kaunigl did venture in; but it
was not quite so simple as he imagined, as he himself
told me afterwards.</p>

<p>"I have played cards," he confessed. "Once."</p>

<p>"Well," said the priest, "card-playing is no sin in
itself, as long as you do not play for money."</p>

<p>"No, I didn't play for money."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>"Where did it happen?"</p>

<p>"On a table."</p>

<p>"What sort of a table?"</p>

<p>"A wooden one."</p>

<p>"Was it on the Corpus Christi table, by any chance?"
asked the priest.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" said Kaunigl.</p>

<p>And then he received absolution.</p>

<p>"Then you lied in your confession!" I said to Kaunigl,
reproachfully.</p>

<p>"That doesn't matter," Kaunigl replied, promptly.
"I can easily mention the lie next time: I'll get that
through the grating right enough. The thing is to have
the card-playing off my chest. Hang it all, though, I
was nearly caught: Old Nick might have grabbed me
finely!"</p>

<p>I based my own inferences upon this experience. If
card-playing was no sin in itself&mdash;and we did not play
for money&mdash;then there was no need to confess the story.
Nor is it stated in either the Lesser or the Greater Catechism
that man shall not play cards on altars. However,
this subtle interpretation helped me not at all. When I
thought of that Corpus Christi sacrilege, in which I had
so foolishly taken part, I often felt quite ill. I dreamt of
it at nights, in the most uncomfortable way, and, sitting
in church on Sundays, I dared not look at that little
altar-table, which stood there so oddly, as though at
any moment it might burst into speech and betray me.
Moreover, about this time, I read in an old devotional
book the story of a blasphemous shoemaker's assistant
who had mimicked the elevation of the Host in a public-house
and how his upraised arms had stiffened in the
act, so that he could not bend them back again and had
to go about with his arms sticking up in the air, until
he was released by receiving absolution from a pious
father. It was much as though I were doomed to go
about with arm uplifted, holding the best trump in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
hand, while the people laughed at me: "Now then,
Peter, play! Why don't you play?" and as though I
played the card, at last, and, in so doing, played my
poor soul to perdition. That was the sort of thing; and
a nice thing too!</p>

<p>I could never manage to settle it by myself: that was
quite clear. So, one evening, after working-hours, I went
to see the parish-priest at St. Catherine's. He was standing
just outside the house, beside his fish-pond, which
was covered over with a rusty wire netting, while a fine
spring bubbled away in the middle. The priest no doubt
thought that I was merely passing by accident, for he
beckoned to me with his black straw hat to come to
him.</p>

<p>"What do you say, Peter?" he cried to me, in his
soft voice. "Nine and five and seven: doesn't that make
twenty-one?"</p>

<p>I was never much good at mental arithmetic; however,
this time, I hazarded, on the off-chance:</p>

<p>"Yes, that should be about right. Twenty-one."</p>

<p>"Now then," he said, "just look here." And he
pointed to the fish-pond. "A fortnight ago, the Blasler
boy sold me nine live trout and I put them in the pond.
A week ago, he sold me five more and I put them in too;
and, to-day, he sold me seven and I put them in as well.
And how many are there now, all told? Eight, eight;
and not one more! And I know all about it: they are
the same which he brought me a fortnight ago; and it
must be so: the scoundrel, I was almost saying, stole
the fish each time out of the pond and sold them to me
over again. It's a &hellip; a &hellip;"</p>

<p>And he shook his fist in the air.</p>

<p>The fact was that the Blasler boy must have stolen
the trout to begin with, before he sold them for the first
time, for Blasler had no fishing licence. This, I dare say,
hardly occurred to the good priest's mind: he was thinking
only of his fast-days. The commandments of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Church allow fish on Fridays and Saturdays,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12" href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> but do not
say whether the fish may be stolen or not.</p>

<p>It was not a favourable opportunity to confess one's
sins. So I forbore for the present, kissed the sleeve of
his coat, because the clenched fist did not look inviting
for a kiss of the hand, and passed on. On the way, I
pondered the question at length, which was the greater
sin, the Blasler boy's or mine. His appeared to me in
the light of a piece of roguery, whereas mine might easily
be a sin against the Holy Ghost; and those sins are not
remitted.</p>

<p>A few days later, Cap Casimir, of Kressbachgraben, was
driving a grey nanny-goat with two kids along the road.
The old goat had a full udder; and the young ones
skipped around her and wanted to have a drink. But
Cap Casimir hissed, in his sloppy brogue:</p>

<p>"Sshh, shtop that now! We musht bring the full
udder to hish reverensh!"</p>

<p>I was at once curious to know what it meant; and
Casimir, who was an immigrant Tyrolese and still wore
his pointed "star-pricker,"<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13" href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> said:</p>

<p>"It'sh like thish, you shee, my wife'sh dead. 'The
goat,' said she, 'and the kidsh,' said she, 'I leave to the
parish-priesht of Kathrein. For prayers and masshes.'
That was her will; and then she died. Sho now I'm
driving the animalsh to the reverend gentleman'sh."</p>

<p>"All right," thought I to myself. "And I'll follow in
an hour's time. He'll be in a good humour to-day; and
I shall never find a better opportunity."</p>

<p>So far, the thing was well thought out. I went off
that same afternoon. The old gentleman was quite jolly
and invited me to have a cup of coffee with him, telling
me that there was fresh milk in it from Kressbachgraben.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>
<p>And it was in the midst of the coffee that I suddenly
said:</p>

<p>"I've had something on my mind for ever so long,
your reverence!"</p>

<p>"You, something on your mind?" he laughed. "Well,
that's a nice state of affairs, when even little boys have
things on their minds!"</p>

<p>I stirred my cup of coffee vigorously with my spoon,
so as not to have to look his reverence in the face, and
told him the story of the game of cards on the altar.</p>

<p>Contrary to all my expectations, the priest remained
quite calm. Then he asked:</p>

<p>"Did you do it wilfully? Did you intend to mock
the holy altar?"</p>

<p>"Good God, no, your reverence!" I replied, thoroughly
shocked at the mere thought.</p>

<p>"Very well," said the old man.</p>

<p>Then he was silent for a little while and finished his
coffee, after which he spoke as follows:</p>

<p>"It was not a proper thing to do; let me tell you that
at once. And I will let Kaunigl know also that what
people take to church is prayer-books and not playing-cards!
But, if you had no bad intention in doing this
silly trick, we will say no more about it this time. At
any rate, you did quite right to tell me. Would you like
a drop more?"</p>

<p>As the Corpus Christi incident was now closed in the
best possible way, the second cup of coffee tasted twice
as good as the first. When, presently, I got up to go,
the old man laid his hand on my shoulder and said,
kindly:</p>

<p>"I feel easier now that I know exactly what happened
on that Corpus Christi Day. But you must never
do it again, Peterkin. Just think,&mdash;our dear Lord!&hellip;"</p>

About Kickel, who went
to Prison</h2>


<p class="cap2"><span class="upper">You</span> were on for a bit of gipsying, were you, Peterkin?
Home, everlastingly home, isn't very cheerful&mdash;always
having the green-glazed mug to drink from, always
having your face wiped over by the mother with a wet rag,
always having to sleep in the little box-bed by the stove&mdash;it's
no fun! One can't help wanting sometimes to gather
a dinner from the whortleberry plants and drink from
the brook, to roll on the ground sometimes, and even to
walk about in mud; and now and again one wants to
sleep in an old hay barn, with water never seen before
rushing along outside, in an unknown gorge, with quite
strange trees standing in the red sunshine when you wake
up in the morning, and unknown people mowing the
grass in the meadows.</p>

<p>Suppose you long for this, and then your father forbids
it! "Children belong at home!" And, "After
school, you will come home by the shortest way!"
The shortest way! There isn't such a thing in our high
lands, especially if Zutrum Simmerl is in school, and if
Zutrum Simmerl says, "Peterl, come with me; at home,
in Zutrumshaus, there are all sorts of jolly things;
a spotted white yard-dog, who's got puppies; cherry-trees,
which are all just red and black; and behind the
house is a charcoal-burner's hut with straw that one can
lie on, and in the stream you can catch trout and crayfish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
with your hand, which your mother can bake and
cook afterwards."</p>

<p>The Zutrum family were far-away cousins of ours, so
that when young Cousin Simmerl said "Come with me,"
one naturally went. It was a whole hour's walk from my
parents' house there, and as the school where we, from
Alpel and Trabachgraben, met together, lay just half-way,
the world became stranger and stranger to me with each
step of my way to Zutrum. And when the sun sank
down over the black saddle of the wooded range, and the
sycamores threw long shadows across the newly mown
meadows, I felt very strange. The hay smelt, the grasshoppers
chirped, the frogs quacked as they did at home,
but all else was different, the mountains much steeper,
the coombs much deeper. I was oppressed. We looked
down at last on the grey shingled roofs of the farm, from
whose whitewashed chimneys thin smoke was going up.
It was already dusk, and the homely smell of charcoal-burning,
which I knew so well, came from among the
tall pines. On the road we made many halts by ant-heaps,
foxes' holes, hedge-stiles, little streams and
puddles; but now Simmerl hurried up. I did not want to
go on, I wanted to turn back. I should be going into a
strange house for the first time in my life&mdash;my courage
gave way. But Simmerl gripped me quickly by the arm
and led me into the farmyard and through the great
door into the house.</p>

<p>The air was cool in the entrance and scented with fruit;
the kitchen was plastered and had nearly white walls,
like an inn. At the open hearth women were busy with
pots and kettles, and to one of them, who had a pale,
pretty, kind face, went Simmerl, gave her his hand and
said, "God greet you, mother!" It was in this house
that I first heard children reverently greeting their parents
at coming in and going out, just as if they were going to
a distant country or were coming back from one. In our
district at home we ran out like a calf from its stall, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
the most that I ever said in the morning when I was off to
school was, "I'm going now," and the mother answered,
"Well, go, in God's name." That was certainly something,
but it was not so cordial and fine as when the
Zutrum children said "God greet you!" or "God keep
you!" and clasped their parents' hands. In short, this
entrance into the Zutrums' house appeared very splendid
to me.</p>

<p>"And that is my school-friend, Peterl, from the Forest
farm," so Simmerl introduced me to his mother.</p>

<p>"Now, that's nice!" she said; wiped her right hand
on her blue apron and held it out to me. I was not quite
sure if my little paw ought to be stretched out too,
hesitated, but finally did it.</p>

<p>"Mother," called Simmerl, "we are running down to
the brook."</p>

<p>"Not too far&mdash;it will soon be supper-time."</p>

<p>We were in the open air again, and it had all gone off
very smoothly. We did not get to the brook that evening,
for there was the white, spotted yard-dog with puppies!
These last were all together in mottled heap, which
constantly surged and twisted, while every now and then
a tiny creature hardly bigger than a rat got loose and
rolled clumsily away. These things were absolutely all
head, and the head again was all muzzle, and the muzzles
burrowed to the teats which the old white dapple placed
ready for use. All that, and the anxious growling of
the old dog and the frightened whimpering of the young
ones, and the doggy smell which came out of the kennel,
nearly stupefied me with sheer delight.</p>

<p>"Does she bite?" I asked Simmerl; for I wanted to
stroke the puppies.</p>

<p>"Not now, so we have taken the chain off her. My
father says, 'She has no enemies now, she is just a mother
now.'" But still, when he wanted to lift one of the
young ones, she snapped at his finger.</p>

<p>"Have you got a church?" I asked, for a little bell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
rang. Simmerl laughed, for it was the house-bell, and
it was calling people to supper.</p>

<p>In the room, where it was already nearly dark, stood
two great square tables. When grace had been said out
loud by everybody and all together, and the great big
soup-tureens were sending up their warm, savoury clouds,
about twelve young men, older men, young girls and old
women sat themselves down to the one table. At the
other table right in the corner the house-father took his
place, a stout, comfortable, cheerful man with a smooth-shaven
face and a double chin; then came his children,
from the merry grown-up Sennerl right down to Simmerl,
and still further down to two quite tiny babies, who had
their milk-soup spooned into their little mouths by the
servant-maid. I was allowed to sit by Simmerl, and,
because the common bowl was rather a long way from
us, we received a little special basin, out of which we
ladled the pieces. It was wheaten bread, which was
not every day to be had at home with us! The house-mother
went to and fro, looking after the tables, and now
and then she sat down with us for a short time, just to eat
a morsel as she passed by. Ah, yes, that was like my
mother at home. "Who cooks needs nothing to eat,"
say overwise people.</p>

<p>I was obliged to keep thinking of home, where just then
they would be waiting for me with supper, and wondering
why that boy didn't come home and where he could
possibly be. Then, probably, it would occur to one or
other of them, "Oh, he has gone home with his school-friend
to Zutrum."</p>

<p>After the milk-soup came a bowl of salad in vinegar.
That again was something new for me; at my home
there was only salad in butter-milk, which is acid and
wet and can therefore well take the place of expensive
vinegar. At home we ate the greenstuff with a spoon,
here one did it with a fork. I several times stabbed my
mouth with the strange tool, but dared make no noise;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
whereas at home if such a thing happened there would
have been a fine outcry.</p>

<p>After the salad came the largest dish of all, and this
contained stewed cherries in their own juice. Now I
might use the spoon again. If only it had been a bit
bigger&mdash;for this black cherry stew was delicious! The
company was very ceremonious. They squeezed the
stones out of their mouths and put them back either on
to a plate or into their fists. At home we ate the stones
with the cherries.</p>

<p>I do not know what was talked about at table, and I
was certainly quite indifferent to it, because mere talk
is nothing to eat. They were louder and gayer at the
servants' table than we were over at the house-father's
table, because there was an old man amongst them
who said the strangest things in the gravest manner at
which they all laughed, until a maid said, "No, no; one
must not laugh so at Kickel. It isn't right that Kickel
should be laughed at."</p>

<p>"Who's laughing at <em>him</em>?" laughed a boy. "We're
only laughing because we please to."</p>

<p>I must have overheard that, as otherwise I should not
have known it. I know also that suddenly the old Kickel
jumped up from his place, and with his shirt-sleeve fluttering
from his wide, strong arm, chucked a cherry-stone
at the door opposite, which fell back again into the
middle of the room. At that he cried "Bang!" and
shouted with laughter. He did this several times,
whereupon the others said, "It was quite right, and he
must make a hole in the door so that one could look out
into the kitchen to see whether or no stew was being
cooked to-day." Then Kickel raised his other arm, and
"Bang!"&mdash;he threw the entire handful at the door, so
that it rattled like a hail-storm. At the same moment
the old man wrinkled up his wizened face and shouted
out an angry curse.</p>

<p>Then the house-father got up from our table, went to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
the infuriated old fellow and said soothingly, "Now,
now, Kickel, don't be so vexed. Sowing so many cherry-trees
in the rooms! None of them will grow, you know.
Be sensible, Kickel." At my home the father would
have talked very differently if such a person had strewn
the room full of cherry-stones!</p>

<p>Then the old servant stood before the house-father
with folded hands, and in a voice of groaning anxiety he
cried, "Zutrum, Zutrum, I don't know how to help
myself, it's coming on again!"</p>

<p>"Michel! Natzel!" said the house-father to the other
two men, "take Kickel to bed. It is time for him to go
to sleep."</p>

<p>Then they led Kickel away. Whatever did it mean?</p>

<p>"It's time for the children to go to sleep also," added
the house-father. "The Forest-farm boy must sleep in
the top room."</p>

<p>The disappointment was bitter. I had thought that
Simmerl and I would have been able to lie near each
other on a pile of hay, and this was actually the reason
that I had come with him into this strange house. Tears
came into my eyes in proportion to the anguish of finding
out that it was all up with the hay, and that I had to
sleep by myself in a dark little room. The house-mother
must have noticed something, for she said, "He can very
well sleep in the little room with Simmerl; there's a
bed empty there."</p>

<p>"Well and good, but don't talk long, boys." So the
house-father, after which Simmerl went to his parents,
kissed their hands and said "Good night."</p>

<p>This custom pleased me mightily, and I resolved to
introduce it also into my home. I never got so far as
that; I had always been ashamed of being entirely
naughty to my parents, but also of being quite good,
and in particular it had been impossible to me to show
certain courtesies, much as I liked them.</p>

<p>I gathered from the order "not to talk long" that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
had permission to talk, and as we lay, each in his little
bed, having put out the light, so that nothing more was
to be seen than the two faintly lighted square windows,
I asked Simmerl, "What was wrong with that fellow
Kickel?"</p>

<p>"Cherry-stones," answered the lad.</p>

<p>"Why did he get so wild?"</p>

<p>"Oh, poor old Kickel!" said my comrade. "Don't
you know that he was in prison for ten years? Last
year they let him out."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because the Kaiser was married."</p>

<p>"What, they locked him up for that?"</p>

<p>"No, that's why they let him out."</p>

<p>"But, good Lord, I want to know why they put him in
prison," I cried.</p>

<p>"If you shout like that father will come with the
strap. He killed his son."</p>

<p>This was horrible. I did not know whether Kickel or
House-father Zutrum had killed his son. I dared question
no farther, and when I did try it later Simmerl gave no
answer, for he was asleep.</p>

<p>Next morning we were awakened by a clear voice,
"Schoolboys, it's time!" A bough of elder swayed
about in front of the heart-shaped opening in the shutter,
and through it the sun shone hot and bright on to our
snow-white beds, and the house-spring splashed outside.
I should have liked to dress at the same time as Simmerl,
but was shy about drawing my legs from under the
coverlet. With a long arm I drew my trousers from the
bench into bed, and slipped them on to my limbs with
a suggestive slickness, and so out to the spring. After
the washing the morning prayers. Simmerl, out of
consideration for his guest, would have gone out during
these, suggesting that he would then take me to the grey
horse in the stable; but his mother said, "He will see
enough grey horses during his life; you need the Holy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Spirit in school. Now say your morning prayer. Both
kneel together."</p>

<p>We knelt on the bench before the table, and each said an
Our Father to himself, while it occurred to me, "We are
not so strict at home." Certainly, our mother said one
ought to say one's prayers, but she did not order one
straight away on to the bench.</p>

<p>Now I was to see too what came of the prayers. We
had hardly raised our elbows from the table when it
was spread with a white cloth, and set with white platters
and with white bread, and a brown soup was poured
out of the spout of a bright tin pot. At home it was just
the other way round, everything else brown and the
soup white. There was no milk-soup for breakfast
here, but coffee! I had already heard about it, that
the grand people ate coffee, but that an old charcoal-burner
had said, "My dear people, I am certainly black.
Look at me and see if I'm black or no! But I'm not so
black and bad as the black broth from Morocco. The
devil has invented it, and the peasant will come to an
end if he eats it."</p>

<p>I do not know if the charcoal-burner knew how wisely
he had spoken, and I do not know if they had believed
him. I only know that everyone was crazy for coffee,
and that I could not help putting my spoon into the
black soup&mdash;Ugh! that isn't good, that is as bitter as
gall! The devil has certainly invented it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"You haven't put any sugar," laughed Simmerl, and
threw some pieces out of a cup into my bowl. Now it was
a little different. Simmerl looked at me and grinned to
himself. I should have liked to know why.</p>

<p>After breakfast it was "God keep you!" to the Zutrum
people and off to school. I had become quite brave and
held out my right hand when saying "Good-bye and
thank you," just like a well-mannered, grown-up man,
and it occurred to me, "How easy it is to be good when
one is not at home!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>As we went along the hill-meadow old Kickel was to be
seen with a wooden fork spreading haycocks out so that
they should dry better in the new sunshine. To-day I
saw, for the first time, that he was very decrepit, bent
double almost to cracking-point, and swaying and
limping at every step. His knee-breeches had certainly
once been leather, but now they had many, many patches
of other stuffs stuck on with large, ungainly stitches.
His feet and very brown ankles were bare. Breast and
arms were covered by a coarse brown shirt; the old felt
hat sat like a battered inverted kettle on the little grey
head, but all the same it was decorated by an eagle's
feather, which stood up high into the air. Knees, elbows
and fingers were all so terribly bony that one felt as if the
old man would never be able to do anything properly
for the rest of his life; he was like a deformed and twisted
oak tree up on the high land where the storm-wind
cripples everything. When he caught sight of us he
raised his hat politely and then he went on working.</p>

<p>"Oh, I say," I questioned my schoolfellow, "what
is the matter with Kickel?"</p>

<p>"When we are higher up I'll tell you," answered
Simmerl, and when we came into the wood, where the
ground became more level, he put his arm in mine, and
said, "He had a son, and he shot him."</p>

<p>"By accident? On purpose?" I asked, horrified.</p>

<p>"On purpose&mdash;quite on purpose."</p>

<p>"What had he done then&mdash;the son?"</p>

<p>"Nothing; he was a thorough good fellow, my father
said."</p>

<p>"Good God! And did he hate his son so dreadfully
then?"</p>

<p>"He loved his son ever so much; much too much."</p>

<p>"And therefore shot him down?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know myself how it was," acknowledged
Simmerl.</p>

<p>"So Kickel is mad?" I put in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>"Not mad, but a bit crazy, certainly; a bit crazy all
his life, and people say one can't imagine how sharp he
used to be, and what a fine keeper he was up there, and
how well educated! But the people say that the many
books he read must have sent him silly."</p>

<p>I quickened my steps.</p>

<p>"Why do you hurry so, Peter?"</p>

<p>"Supposing he runs after us!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Kickel won't do anything to us. People say he
would not have killed his son if he hadn't been so fond
of him."</p>

<p>"Oh, Simmerl, supposing he is fond of us?"</p>

<p>"Oh, not so fond as he was of his son!"</p>

<p>"But, Simmerl, I don't understand."</p>

<p>"Some time I'll ask father just how it all was."</p>

<p>Nothing more. On that particular day I was not much
use in school. Just think!&mdash;My father is very fond of
<em>me</em>. He certainly has never told me so, but mother has
said it to me. If things are like this, one will never trust
oneself again with people who are fond of one.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with Peter?" asked the schoolmaster,
"he is so absent-minded to-day."</p>

<p>In the afternoon I came back to my parents' house.
I stood awhile rooted to the sandy ground behind the
pines. What was going to happen next? My father
came towards me with a clacking wheelbarrow. "Go in
and eat," he called to me, "and afterwards come out into
the wood. We must cut down some wood for firing."</p>

<p>"Did you sleep at Zutrum last night?" asked my
mother, as she set before me the dinner which had been
saved for me.</p>

<p>"Mother, Simmerl wouldn't let go of me until I went
home with him."</p>

<p>"It's quite right, child. Just lately Mistress Zutrum
was complaining to your father that you did not come
to see your cousins and aunt and uncle. My mother and
the mother of Mistress Zutrum were sisters."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>The danger was quite over. Out in the forest I asked
my father whether he knew the Zutrums' old servant,
Kickel, and what was the matter with him.</p>

<p>"It isn't the time for gossip now, it's the time for
cutting firewood,"&mdash;that was his answer.</p>

<p>A few weeks later I was with my father in the cattle
pasture. It was already dusk, and the oxen, who had been
yoked to the plough all day, thrust their muzzles into the
food and grazed busily. We stood by and waited until
they were satisfied. It occurred to me that now was the
time for gossip, and I asked him again about Kickel.</p>

<p>"Child, let Kickel be," answered my father. "He's
never harmed you&mdash;and may God Almighty preserve
from all craziness! See&mdash;they won't eat the grass&mdash;they're
not hungry any more."</p>

<p>Soon after, we led the oxen into the farmyard. If I
had died at that time, reader, you would hardly ever
have learnt anything about Kickel. Meanwhile, I grew
into a thin, but sadly tall lad, too narrow for a peasant,
but long enough for a town gentleman&mdash;well, you know
all about that!</p>

<p>And once on a time, in summer, as I was going to visit
far-away Alpel again, in the forest on the way I overtook
a peasant lad&mdash;a young, handsome but earnest fellow,
in Sunday clothes although it was a work-day. He had
an upright carriage, and moved his legs lightly and
regularly in walking, so that I thought, "He has been a
soldier, or is one still." His auburn hair, too, was cut
short and shaved behind in such fashion that his round,
fresh-coloured neck was bare for a couple of inches down
to his shirt-collar. The long face, with the somewhat
thinly modelled nose, the very fair little moustache
and the open, shrewd eyes, suggested that he was by no
means one of the most foolish and simple of people.
In those days I was as glad to have company on such a
road as now I am to go alone. So I tried it on with him.
My question was, where he went? He was going home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
to his wood-cutting in Fischbacherwald. "Where had he
been?" In Krieglach, in the churchyard. "What had
so lively a young fellow to do with the churchyard?"</p>

<p>"Well, it's just what happens often enough," answered
he. "It was on account of old Kickel."</p>

<p>Old Kickel! I had often heard the name mentioned.
Ah, yes! it was the old servant at Zutrum, who&mdash;&mdash;
"We'll go together, so that it will be more entertaining.
I am Peter from the Forest farm." That was my introduction.</p>

<p>"I've known you before," was his answer. "I have
often met you in Graz when I was with the soldiers, but
you have never recognised me."</p>

<p>"And why have you never made yourself known since
you were from home?"</p>

<p>"I wanted to speak to you once, but I thought, 'A
common soldier! Who knows if he'd like it?'"</p>

<p>"Naturally&mdash;you a common soldier&mdash;and I absolutely
nothing."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;not that," he rejoined. "You are already
somebody. I know it well."</p>

<p>"So they have buried Kickel to-day! And where are
the others, then?"</p>

<p>"The few people have already gone on. Not many of
them followed him. He was only a poor pauper."</p>

<p>"You have surely been one of the bearers?"</p>

<p>"No," said he; "I have only followed on after.
There has been no praying even, because they said he had
been a heathen. I thought to myself that he wasn't
any worse than most other people, and that he had had
bad luck&mdash;it was certainly his fate. Now in God's name
he has rest."</p>

<p>"What bad luck did he have, then?" was my question.
I believed that I was at last near to the satisfaction of my
old and now re-awakened curiosity.</p>

<p>"You will have heard of the story before," said my
road companion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>"Yes, just rumours; but never knew where they
came from. Do you know anything exactly?"</p>

<p>"I know all about it," said he.</p>

<p>And I had led him on so far that he began to tell me
everything. It is again many years since then, but one
never forgets such things, and now I will tell the story
of Kickel.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Isidor Kickel was the only son of a steward at the
Schloss of Prince Schwarzenberg, in Muran. He had to
study, and wanted to also, but suddenly dropped it all in
his seventeenth year, just when he should have repeated
his annual course. After that he tried an agricultural
school, learnt forestry and became a forester. But he
only got as far as being a forester's assistant or huntsman,
and as this he was placed in the Imperial forests at
Neuberg. He ought, perhaps, to have been a scholar,
for there was something speculative in him, and he read
many books in his spare time. He was much too much in
books. He said such things oftentimes, and kept so away
from church, that the people said: 'Huntsman Kickel
has fallen away from the Christian faith.' That often
happens to-day," commented my travelling companion.
"At that time it was something novel. No one knew how
he felt about it himself inside; the people said it could not
feel quite right. Otherwise he was not a bad man. Once
when he was in the church during a feast, he took money
out of his purse and wanted to give it to the bell-pocket
man, but the man passed by him as if to say, 'You
monster, your money is too bad for me.' Whereupon
Kickel gave the coins to a poor little old woman; they
were not too bad for her, and the people laughed no end!
Once a swallow flew into the church and could not get
out again, because the windows have wire-netting and
the door was at the far end. And no one could catch
her, either. So Kickel went into the church every day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
and the sacristan thought he had been converted. Kickel,
however, was only taking in bird's food so that the
swallow should not starve. And as to conversion, there
was nothing of that sort at all. In spite of everything,
people liked him well, and nobody could accuse him of
anything wrong. Then he married a schoolmaster's
daughter from the Veitsch, and had seven children; and
of these he lost six by death while they were quite little,
three at one time, and his wife also through consumption.
Only one single child remained to him, a boy called
Oswald. One often sees that people who are unable to
believe in a future life are all the more thirsty for life here,
and for love too. It was just that way with Kickel. His
love for this only child became an overwhelming passion,
and all and everything which lay in his power that could
make life lovely for the handsome, merry young Oswald,
he gave him. He had him taught, and when he was
twelve years old wanted to send him to an Institute in
Vienna; but, on the other hand, Oswald wanted to stay
among his home mountains, and the huntsman had to
force himself to thrust him out. A few years later he
secured him a clerkship in the State Forestry Office at
Neuberg, and a few years after that there was a wedding.</p>

<p>"Oswald's choice was a pretty daughter of a burgher of
Mürzzuschlag. The love-story apparently was just like
other love-stories, and went much the same road as they.
Oswald became master-woodman in the Hochschlag,
behind Mürzsteg, on the high Veitsch. After barely a
year, naturally enough, the 'little lad' was there, and
Oswald could say to his father, 'I can wish nothing
better for myself, and only fear lest things should become
worse!' So he must have been a much more contented
man than his father, and no one ever heard how he stood
with regard to religion. His wife," continued my lad,
"has often told me since, that he laid his arm round her
neck and said, 'God be praised and thanked that I have
you!' So he must have believed <em>something</em>. And his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
father, Kickel, just revelled in joy because all went so
well for his Oswald.</p>

<p>"Huntsman Kickel lived in an old dismantled farm-house,
in the only room which was still habitable. At
that time he was suffering with a wound in his foot,
which he had got by leaping from a rock, and for months
he had been unable to go into the coverts. As Oswald on
Sundays went up to his mountain-hut from the valley,
his way led him past, and he spoke to his father to ask
him how the sick leg was, and to bring him this thing or
the other and to chat with him about his wife and his
dear boy. He often brought the boy with him, too, and
then Huntsman Kickel would throw his boxes and cupboards
open and invite son and grandson to take with
them anything that particularly pleased them.</p>

<p>"'Take&mdash;just take them all,' he would always say;
'they're mere nothings. The little bit of pleasure in
this world! I've had my share, and there's nothing
beyond. And if things get worse&mdash;end it!'</p>

<p>"Then that Sunday came. It was in August, and so hot
in the morning that the young master-woodman Oswald
begged a glass of water of his father on his way to church.</p>

<p>"'When I come back after noon,' he said to his father,
'I will pay you for the well with St. John's blessing.'
He meant by that he would bring wine with him. The
old man answered that he ought to take it up to the
little wife and the laddie. But they were in want of
nothing; the little wife sang from dawn onwards like a
lark, and little Anderl had laughed in his sleep as he,
Oswald, before going out, had kissed him.</p>

<p>"'Ah, you poor burdened fellow!' Huntsman Kickel
said again, and clapped his son on the shoulder and then
'Good-bye till this afternoon.'</p>

<p>"About midday a storm arose over the Hochschwab
Mountain. It did not rain much, but the thunder crashed
heavily several times. An hour later a woodman came
down from the hill, who called into the open windows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
'Huntsman Kickel, look up if you want to see the
smoke!'</p>

<p>"'What's the matter? What are you shouting for?'
asked Kickel, who was quite alone in the house.</p>

<p>"'The mountain-hut is burning&mdash;the lightning struck
it.'</p>

<p>"'What do you say, woodman?'</p>

<p>"'When the master-woodman comes home he will
find nothing left. Everything has gone!'</p>

<p>"'The wife? The child?'</p>

<p>"'Everything's gone. If your son goes home, prepare
him for it. I must go to Niederalpel.'</p>

<p>"That was what the woodman said&mdash;and then he was
off."</p>

<p>I cannot repeat as my fellow-wayfarer told it; it went
straight into my heart like a knife. But the young fellow
remained unmoved, and went on telling:</p>

<p>"No one knows what Huntsman Kickel thought of this
message. At first he wanted to go up to the heights
where the black smoke was making the whole heavens
dark. But he was unable, because of the bad foot.
'His wife and his child! His wife and his child! His
wife and his child!' The whole time just that. 'End
it!' Kickel went into the parlour and stared out of the
window. 'Now he's coming&mdash;and now he's coming.'
He took the gun from the wall and stood in the middle
of the parlour and looked out through the window to the
path outside. At last he came, Oswald, out from the
green wood; he did not look up, and still did not know
anything about it, and came so quickly and gaily to
the house where his father lived. And Huntsman Kickel
aimed through the window and shot him down."</p>

<p>"Jesus Christ!" I cried. "Had he gone mad?"</p>

<p>"One cannot say that," answered the lad. "When
his old housekeeper came home, he sent her at once for
a cart, went to the police, and when examined he said
he could not endure that his Oswald should have trouble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
and go on living, and he had thought to himself, 'He
knows nothing, and needs to know nothing. That useless
grieving for many a day and year is quite unnecessary.
A quick death, and you are after them, you are set free
from everything&mdash;and I, your father, can do you no
better service than that.' He said, 'I did not aim badly;
and now, your honours, please make an end of me.' I
believe they gave him fifteen years, but when the Kaiser
married in fifty-four they let him off the rest."</p>

<p>I went thoughtfully along the woodland path, and
said:</p>

<p>"It's almost beyond belief."</p>

<p>"It was best," continued my companion, "that they
fetched him away at once and took him to Loeben. He
couldn't have lived after knowing the worst of all."</p>

<p>"What the woodman said&mdash;was it not true, then?"
I asked it with my breath stopping.</p>

<p>"Yes, the lightning had certainly struck the hill-hut
and it was burnt down, but nothing had happened to
Oswald's family."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It's awful to think of the fate of some men!</p>

<p>We went on together for a while; neither said a word.</p>

<p>At last I stood still and asked, "When did he learn
it?"</p>

<p>"When after nine years he had been free for half a year,
and he came home and was always laughing in the air,
then I told it him myself."</p>

<p>"How did you say it to him?"</p>

<p>"'Father Kickel, your daughter-in-law and your grandson
Anderl are still alive, and all is well with them.'"</p>

<p>"And what did he say to that?"</p>

<p>"'So,' said he, 'they are still alive? And I had
always dreamt that they were all dead, all! God, what
tales the young people tell!' And then he laughed
again."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>"Ah&mdash;mad then!"</p>

<p>"It must have been so," said my companion. "For a
while after that he tried to earn his bread as a farm-servant,
but later on, as he couldn't succeed in that, he
came on the parish. As a rule, one saw nothing amiss
with him, but many a time one did&mdash;many a time one
did."</p>

<p>"You knew him quite well?" I asked the young
fellow.</p>

<p>"Well, naturally," was his answer; "he was my
grandfather."</p>

How I Came to the Plough</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">This</span> is one of the very shortest, but also one of
the most important chapters in my story. It
takes me out of my first childish youth and my herding
time, and brings me to the days of my young manhood
and of work filled with conscious purpose.</p>

<p>It needed many an artful trick before I managed to
get promoted from cowherd to ploughman. I had to
sprain my foot, so that I could not run after the cattle
properly; I had to find birds' nests in the meadow,
which inclined my younger brother to take over my
herdsman's duties in my stead; lastly, I had to coax
Markus the farm-hand, who had driven the plough till
then, into declaring that it was an easy-going implement,
as simple to handle as a pocket-knife, and that
I&mdash;the callow lad&mdash;was fairly strong enough and fit to
guide the plough.</p>

<p>And I stood there and drew myself up until I reached
at least as high as long Markus's shoulders, and I shook
one of the fence-posts until it groaned&mdash;as a proof of my
fitness for the plough. But my father laughed and said:</p>

<p>"Get out, you're a little swaggerer! What you need
is a good breeches-dusting given you every day. And
now he's pretending to be grown up. Very well, take
hold; it won't last long!"</p>

<p>We were in the fields when he spoke. Markus stood
back; and I took the plough by the horns.</p>

<p>The plough in the neighbourhood of my home is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
different, certainly, from the bent bough of the savage,
but it remains a clumsy, imperfect implement. The
farmer puts it together himself out of birch-wood, fetching
only the iron portions from the smith and the wheels from
the cartwright. The chief parts of the plough are the
coulter, or plough-iron, which cuts the turf vertically,
and the share, which slices it horizontally, thus creating
a grassy sod which has four sides to it, and is about a
span wide and half a span thick. Then there is the
mould-board, which lifts the cut sod out of the furrow
and turns it over, so that the grassy side comes to lie
at the bottom. Further portions, by means of which
these chief parts are fastened to the body of the plough,
are called the coulter-beam, the sill-beam, the "cat."
All these appliances have to be in duplicate, as required
by the progress up and down the hilly field, turn and
turn about. In front is the beam, lying on the axle-tree,
to which a pair of oxen are usually harnessed. At the
back of the plough, three "horns" or tails stick out;
these are the handles by which the plough is driven by
a powerful man. It depends upon the driving of this
ploughman whether the sod be made wide or narrow
and the furrow deep or shallow; it is this man's duty to
fix and lift the plough at the edge of the field; he must
also be able, on stony ground, to pull the plough out of
the way of any larger stone than usual, for the oxen
cannot be brought suddenly to a standstill; and the
plough, if left to itself, would soon go to wreck and ruin.</p>

<p>Over and above this ploughman, the vehicle also
needs a driver, who leads the oxen in such a way that
one of the pair is always stepping in the furrow and the
other on the sod. Then, lastly, there has to be a "follower."
This is usually a girl, who comes after the plough
with a hoe, presses down the sods that have not been
well turned, cuts out faulty furrows, and, in short, acts
as the corrector of the plough.</p>

<p>You see that the thing is far from simple. It means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
a long day's work to dig an acre and a half of sloping land
with one plough. Well, how did the young ploughman
fare?</p>

<p>I had taken the bull firmly by the horns. But it
really was a bull. The apparatus had allowed Markus to
handle it like a toy; it looked as though he only held
on to the handles for fun. It was quite a different business
with me. The cattle pulled. I was plunged to right
and left by the handles; the plough tried to jump out
of the rut; and my little bare feet got caught now and
then under the clods.</p>

<p>"He's too short in the buttocks!" I heard father and
the labourer say, laughing.</p>

<p>This speech roused me. My honour, my manhood
were at stake. I no longer wanted to be the duffer who
had to sit at the bottom corner of the table, who dared
not put a word in edgewise, who, if he knew of anything
that had happened, was free to go and talk it over with
the sheep and calves outside. I had the most ambitious
views; I wanted to be big and strong and independent,
like the farm-labourer. And behold, the higher a man
aims, the taller he grows! I drove the plough and cut a
passable furrow. The earth-worms, disturbed by the
plough, lifted their heads in surprise and looked up to
see who was ploughing to-day!</p>

<p>My father's fields had tough, yellowish-red earth,
interwoven with grass-roots; and the sods formed an
endless gut, and were hardly once in a way interrupted
throughout the tract of land to be ploughed. I was glad
of that, for it made the plough remain always evenly in
position, and the furrow became more regular than any
pond-digger's work. But my father was not so glad; he
would rather have had black, soft sods:</p>

<p>"Black earth, white bread!" says the proverb.</p>

<p>When I was driving the plough across the field for
the third time, I took a peep to see how high the sun
stood in the sky. Alas, that clock had stopped! There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
were clouds in front of it. Suppose God should be angry
and refuse to let it become noon to-day!&hellip;</p>

<p>It seemed a long time before mother, when dinner was
ready, appeared in the loft at the top of the house, as
my grandmother had done before her, put two fingers to
her mouth, and sent forth the shrill, peculiar whistle
which I knew so well. I let go the handles and confessed
that mother had never whistled so musically before.</p>

<p>Then came dinner. I took good care not to wipe the
earth from my hands, for even this crust gave me a certain
air; I was no longer the duffer, I was the ploughman, I
enjoyed equal rights with the labourers. I sat down
beside the head man and did my best to talk in a weighty
fashion. They spoke of my performance; then I was
silent, for my performance spoke for itself.</p>

<p>It is a small incident in one's youth, it is hardly big
enough to be worth mentioning; but, for the farmer, it
is a great and momentous day when he puts his hand to
the plough for the first time&mdash;it is a sacred act. The
sword, the Cross, are objects of respect; and I look upon
the plough also as a symbol of the redemption of the
world. The grey earth-dust which clung to my hands
that time, and with which I went in to dinner&mdash;I have
not wiped it off to this day&mdash;was to me what the golden
pollen-dust is to the bee.</p>

<p>And so I may be permitted to add that, in that same
year, I tilled the whole of that field; that my father
sowed the seed there with a pious hand; and that, next
spring, the corn stood glad and green and glorious.</p>

<p>"I haven't seen such a field of corn these ten years
past," said my father, when he saw it.</p>

The Recruit</h2>


<p class="cap2"><span class="upper">Never</span> in my life shall I forget that February
morning. It was only to be expected; and yet it
took us by surprise.</p>

<p>I was a little over twenty years of age. Though I
already felt a regular young man and did my very
best to act as such, still I always looked upon myself
as a child, for I was ever so considered by my parents
and to a certain extent so treated by my teacher. I
had to stoop nowadays, when I entered the house
through the door; and, when I stood by the table-corner
in the parlour, my head reached up to the Holy
Trinity on the wall, to espy whose mystery I had so
often, as a boy, scrambled up chair and table. But
people still always called me by my short pet name;
and I still answered to it. And so, silently, that February
morning came upon us.</p>

<p>It was a Sunday. I had come back from a long job,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14" href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
and meant to have a pleasant rest. When I awoke, my
father was standing by the bed and said it was high time
for me to get up, he wanted to speak to me.</p>

<p>"Do you owe any money to Bürscher the innkeeper at
Krieglach?" he asked, and waited anxiously for my
answer.</p>

<p>I asked him why he put such a question to me: what
I had drunk at Bürscher's I had always paid for.</p>

<p>"So I should have thought. It's only because Bürscher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
has sent me a paper to-day, which belongs to you, I'm
thinking."</p>

<p>He gave me the paper: it was grey; and I turned
red. Father noticed this and said:</p>

<p>"Seems to me there's some disgrace about it, for all
that!"</p>

<p>"Not a disgrace," said I, with my eyes fixed on the
lines, which were part in print and part in writing. "An
honour rather. <em>Present myself</em>, that's what I have to
do."</p>

<p>The paper ran:</p>


<blockquote>

<p class="center">"MILITARY SUMMONS</p>

<p class="ma-top1">"Take note that you, Peter Rosegger, living at house
No. 18 at Alpel, born in the year 1843, in the parish of
Krieglach, are hereby called upon to fulfil your military
obligations by presenting yourself for inspection, at
8 o'clock in the morning on the 14th of March, 1864,
at the appointed place at Bruck, clean-washed and in
clean linen, failing which you will be treated as a deserter
and undergo the usual consequences prescribed by law.</p>

<p class="letterright">Age-class I."</p>


</blockquote>


<p>By this time, my mother was there too. She could not
believe it. Why, it wasn't so long since I was just a
little bit of a chap! And now, all at once, a soldier!</p>

<p>"He's not that yet," said father.</p>

<p>"Give them time. And look at him. They won't send
<em>him</em> home in a hurry. Jesu, Mary! And the chest is
spreading, too, now! That narrow little chest of yours
was always my comfort. And to think that you have
grown so broad all in a year!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>I had jumped out of bed, but did not know how to defend
myself against my disconsolate mother's reproaches.</p>

<p>My father said to her:</p>

<p>"Thank your stars that he's healthy. Do you want a
cripple for a son? Would you rather have had that
than a fine, well-set-up soldier?"</p>

<p>"You're right, of course, Lenzel:<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15" href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> if only I could keep
him with me, though. Sooner or later, he'll have to go
to the front; and I simply can't bear to think of
that."</p>

<p>She wept.</p>

<p>"Get back into bed again," said father to me. "You
could have stayed in bed, if you'd wanted to."</p>

<p>I didn't care about bed now. I was glowing in every
limb. True, I had been secretly awaiting this summons,
in fear and trembling; but, now that it had come,
I had an ever so pleasant and cheerful feeling inside me.
I was filled with joy and pride. The Emperor had sent
for me! I rushed to the door; I could have shouted
from house to house, from hill to hill:</p>

<p>"I'm a recruit!"</p>

<p>There were many weeks yet before the 14th of March.
Mother wanted me not to go on any more jobs, but to
stay at home so that she could have me with her for that
short time. My master, indulgent as ever, yielded to her.
She gave herself up to thinking and planning how to
make this time, the last that I should spend with her,
pleasant to me. She called to mind all my pet dishes.
She asked the market-woman to get beetroot for her
and dried cherries, two things which my palate
specially relished at the time. She scattered more and
more oats before the hens and tried to explain to them
that they would be dispensed from duty the whole of next
summer if only they would lay eggs now, at this great
time; otherwise there would be nothing for it but to
cut off their heads; for a soldier, if he got no eggs to eat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
was not averse to roast fowls, however old and tough&mdash;they
never saw such teeth as a young fellow had who
was just going for a soldier!</p>

<p>Dear mother-heart, once so warm and true, can it be
possible that you are now but a cold bit of clay? How I
yearn for you these days! How I pray that you will let
me love you, as you once prayed to me! You are almost
colder to me now than I was then to you. I never
thought what endless loving-kindness and cheerfulness
and self-sacrifice lay hidden in the little gifts and pleasures
which you prepared for me! I took you, O my mother's
heart, as a man takes the breath of the morning
and the sunshine, without so much as a "Thank
you"!</p>

<p>So, at that time, with the conscription near at hand, I
accepted my mother's tenderness rather casually and,
instead of staying at home with her, went about the
neighbourhood and forgathered with the lads who had
received their summons like myself. True, there were
some among them for whom I had but little fellow-feeling&mdash;I
did not care much for the lads of my neighbourhood,
our tastes lay too far asunder&mdash;but the common
lot now united us, we consorted together, we drank
together in the taverns; and, full of esprit de corps as I
was, I behaved just as wildly as the rest.</p>

<p>Everybody smoked; and it was no longer pipes, but
cigars, to make people think that the Emperor already
had sent army tobacco on ahead for his young recruits.
Everybody strove to walk grand and straight and upright,
though, as I presently found, this resulted rather
in a sort of strut or swagger. Whether everybody had a
sweetheart I can't quite say; but this much is certain,
that everybody sang about his sweetheart. There are
songs about the pretty and the ugly, the faithless and the
deserted, the cold and the warm-hearted; songs for
daily use and songs for special occasions. I joined boldly
in every ditty, as though I owned girls of all sorts and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
descriptions. And yet, all the while, I was secretly afraid
because of my recruiting-favour.</p>

<p>Here let me explain that every lad who is called upon
for conscription gets a many-coloured bunch of ribbons
pinned to his hat by his sweetheart. The ribbons are
mostly red and wave in the breeze&mdash;&mdash;when their wearers
bluster as they should&mdash;&mdash;like flags. The rose or bud-shaped
favours are generally cut out of coloured linen
or paper and have the advantage of always keeping
bright and fresh and not drooping, as real flowers do;&mdash;for
a drooping air won't do for recruits. Only, there is
just one green sprig of rosemary with it, forming the
heart of the favour; and in this green spray the beloved
talks to her lover, saying I know not what sweet and
good things! So long as the beloved has to do with
rosemary, it is the May-time of love.</p>

<p>Now where was <em>I</em> to get my favour from? A sweetheart!
I knew of one, but I had none: I had never reflected
how indispensable the sweetheart is to the
recruit.</p>

<p>Must I, while all the others marched away with fluttering
top-knots, trot favourless behind? And what was
the good of marching and what the good of going for a
soldier, if I left no sobbing girl behind me?</p>

<p>The day arrived.</p>

<p>My mother made as if she were calm, at times even
cheerful, but she had always red eyes. Once she went to
my master and wept and was surprised that he did not
cry too. But he only laughed and said that he did not
see what there was to grieve about: Peter need not be
afraid of soldiering; he would have a good time; he
had learnt tailoring; he might even become a cutter in
the army tailors' department; and then he could laugh
at all of them. But my dear mother wouldn't hear about
laughing, for the time being; she remained disconsolate:
under the circumstances she felt better so. She got
ready for me the finest linen she could lay hold of and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
marked each garment with a little cross; but nothing
further was said about the recruiting, until the last
moment, when I was starting and mother wished to go
with me as far as Krieglach.</p>

<p>"For God's sake, don't!" I cried; for how would it
have gone off if I had marched with mother by my side
and the lads in front of us with their wild songs and chaff!
Pretty badly: such young devils are lads that there
are times when the gentlest mother's son of them all
blushes for his parents.</p>

<p>"Nay, nay, mother," said father to her, "you can't
go; you're no good at that; and they would only poke
fun at the boy."</p>

<p>My mother did not say another word. She did not even
come as far as the front door with me, for fear of getting
me laughed at by the passers-by. Inside, in the parlour,
she dipped her finger in the holy-water stoup and made a
cross with it over my face and then hurried into the next
room, to let her tears flow freely. I felt just a queer
sort of choking at the throat, but did not let it
master me. And I won't warrant that, when, in the
dark passage, I made a quick movement over my eyes,
I did not at the same time wipe off the wet mark of the
cross.</p>

<p>We all met at Stocker's inn on the bridle-path. Everyone,
as I expected, had his hat full of finery; my head
alone was smooth as that of a poor little ram that has
grown no horns yet and has just to be content with its
long ears. Therefore I was still mortally unhappy at the
first glass; at the second, however, I thought of the
shako with the flaunting imperial eagle on it, which I
was as certain of wearing as any of the rest.</p>

<p>There were pretty fellows among them, but also
wretched pigmies who needed their streaming ribbons
to hide their humps, their goitres, and even&mdash;if I may
be allowed a little exaggeration&mdash;their weedy spindle-shanks.
Now where had <em>they</em> got their sweethearts from,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
that they sported such fine favours? They all had their
hats on; I alone had flung mine into a corner, to avoid
the scorn with which, for that matter, they had already
overwhelmed me.</p>

<p>When we broke up at last and I was obliged to fish out
my hat again, I could not find it. For in its place was
another, with a splendid rosette and two ribbons, one
red and the other white; and I now saw that it <em>was</em>
my hat which had been so gloriously favoured by an
unknown hand. Perhaps I had a sweetheart after all!
I reflected, but could hit upon none whom I thought
capable of liking such a "Marry-me-not" as myself.
Stocker, the innkeeper, had nice-looking daughters,
but they were all married. His old wife was reported
to have once been young herself, but the ribbons and
that wonderful, dainty sprig of rosemary could not
possibly date back to that period. And the old woman
played no other part in the business than to whisper
to me that someone had been past the house and secretly
prigged a rosette for me.</p>

<p>Anyway, I had it&mdash;that was the great thing&mdash;and it
looked finer and grander than all the rest. Goodness,
how I racked my brains under that favour! To the
others, however, I behaved as if I knew right well from
whom it came, and I even carried this plan to such a
pitch that I myself began to fix on a definite person and
believed and was soon convinced that it was she I loved.
It's inconceivable how soon a certainty of this sort makes
a man of one! I was now the liveliest of them all as we
went along; and more than one of them said they never
knew that Lenzel's son was such a devil of a fellow.
Which made me feel not a trifle flattered.</p>

<p>One of our numberless jokes was to "make the railway-train
stop." We posted ourselves outside the station and,
as the train came up, yelled and shouted:</p>

<p>"Hi! Stop!"</p>

<p>Then the train stopped and we laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>But things did not always end so harmlessly. We
were seated in the railway-carriage&mdash;the Krieglach Town
Council had given us our fares, which, as we believed,
were sent direct by the Emperor&mdash;when one of us,
Zedel-Zenz, proposed that we should all examine our
tufts of rosemary: he whose spray was beginning to
fade had lain oftenest in his sweetheart's arms. And
then it turned out that the green sprig in my hat was
clinging a little wearily and languidly to the red linen
flowers. This, of course, caused me a fresh inward
alarm. Could this sprig of rosemary know more about
her and more about me than I myself did? Had I
really been favoured already?</p>

<p>"Yes, that goes without saying!" I laughed, swaggering
like anything.</p>

<p>But instead of impressing the others, I only brought
down ridicule upon myself. They spoke of rocking the
cradle and drew all sorts of conclusions from the fading
of the rosemary, until at last I protested angrily. What
had it to do with them? I asked. If anybody had anything
to complain of, let him come on! For it at once
occurred to me, a real recruit must put up with nothing,
must know how to be rude and raise a brawl in due
season. And so I blustered away until I had blustered
myself into a regular, genuine rage, stamping my feet,
waving my arms and actually managing to shatter a
window-pane.</p>

<p>The guard at once appeared. Who had broken the
glass?</p>

<p>"Lenzel's son!" crowed one. "The tailor!"</p>

<p>But the others shouted that it wasn't true and that
we mustn't tell who had done it.</p>

<p>"I want no hushing up from any of you!" I broke in.
"I smashed the pane. What's the damage?"</p>

<p>"We'll see to that at Bruck," answered the guard.
"I'll speak to the captain; the army'll soon tame you,
my lad!"</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>"Now you've done it," thought I to myself; "now
you're a soldier, Lenzel's son."</p>

<p>And I became quite quiet, as if the wintry air, rushing
in through the broken window, had cooled me to good
purpose.</p>

<p>At the station at Bruck there was no more said about
that pane of glass; and, when we went shouting through
the town, I slung my arms round the necks of my companions
on either side of me and felt grateful to them
for their willingness to screen the felon that I was.</p>

<p>From the windows of the houses, the town misses
looked down upon our mad doings; and we were convinced
that they must all be in love with us and that, the
more rudely we behaved and the more wildly the ribbons
streamed from our hats, the more ardent their love must
grow. We had a lurking suspicion that even a farmer's
lad from the mountains, bawling with brag and arrogance
and marching away as the champion of his country,
may, when all is said, possess some little interest for the
city dame.</p>

<p>Now escorted by corporals, we marched back into the
town by the other side and up to a building standing by
itself. Then we went indoors. All of us were a little
flurried; none knew in what condition he would leave
this house again. And here, in the town, the soldier's life
no longer looked so glorious as at home in the still woods.
Most of us&mdash;even though we were not the most pious&mdash;sighed
an "In God's name!" as we blundered up the
steps.</p>

<p>We went into a large hall which was almost like a barn
and in which over a hundred young men were already
gathered. There was a tremendous buzzing and pushing;
and it was a very curious sight. Some, filled with the
gaiety of despair, were jumping up and down on their
stocking-feet or barefoot; others tied up their clothes
and sat down on the bundles and were sad as death.
Others again leant or stood against the walls, like carved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
saints, with the cold sweat on their foreheads. One might
say even of the dwarfs and cripples that their hearts sank
into their trousers, had they still had their trousers on!</p>

<p>I walked round the hall, meaning well by everybody,
but caring to talk to none. They were surprised that I
could keep so indifferent; of the great excitement
bubbling inside me I gave no sign.</p>

<p>Suddenly the entrance-door was locked, which made
one of us whisper:</p>

<p>"Look, the trap's snapped to!"</p>

<p>On the other hand, a door opposite opened; and a
couple of soldiers&mdash;but these were full-blown soldiers&mdash;walked
about among us and pushed one after the other
into the inner room. I then saw some of the palest faces
I ever beheld in my life. Most of them, however, strode
quite bravely through the fateful gate. But we were
numbered. To prevent unfairness in any given age-class,
the order of the muster&mdash;for it is usually to the
recruit's advantage to be one of the last&mdash;the order is
always arranged, a few weeks beforehand, by lot, which
every man liable to military service can draw in person
or allow to be drawn by such persons as he pleases. My
number had been drawn by the Krieglach Town Council;
and it bore the favourable number of 67.</p>

<p>Nearly half of the numbers up to 30 did not come
back. A sergeant fetched their clothes. But those who
did come back wore an all the gladder look, dressed
themselves as quickly as they could, or, for fear lest
the gentleman inside should repent of having let them go,
bundled their clothes under their arms and slipped out
through some hole or other.</p>

<p>Numbers 51 to 65 all came back. Number 66 did
not reappear. The sergeant came for his things. Then,
at last, Number 67 was called. I walked with the utmost
composure&mdash;rather too fast than too slow&mdash;into the
lions' den.</p>

<p>What was there so extraordinary? Three or four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
gentlemen in black coats, with shiny buttons, silver
collars, clattering swords and warlike moustaches. The
blades were smoking cigars. My first thought was,
could they be bribed with a civil "Good morning"?
But I had heard from the men before me that the gentlemen
had not said so much as "Thank you" to this greeting.
We were just "things." And who is going to
exchange greetings with a <em>Number 67</em>? So I bit my
teeth together and held my tongue and sported my most
defiant air.</p>

<p>I was at once put against an upright post. One of the
officers, with a soft pressure of the hand, pushed my chest
out and my knees in and said:</p>

<p>"Sixty-four and a half!"</p>

<p>Another seemed to write it down.</p>

<p>"Chest sound. Muscles might be more developed."</p>

<p>"Give him another year to run about in," said a third.</p>

<p>"Go and dress yourself!"</p>

<p>That was the whole proceeding. I hardly know how I
got back to the front room. As I went out by the steps,
the soldiers on duty stuck their bayonets in my way:
that means a request to the lucky ones for a tip. It
did not need the bayonets: everyone gives, for it is
the moment when he is free to leave the fatal building,
with its often harsh consequences, and return to his dear
home.</p>

<p>Those who are "kept" are mostly also allowed to
go home once more and there await the muster-call;
but they remain in custody on the day itself, until the
gentlemen are finished with the inspection. Then they are
drafted into the regiments and made to take the military
oath; and then they are&mdash;soldiers.</p>

<p>We waited for them in the Bruck taverns. They were
received with loud shouts and cheered with wine and
song; and, if many a "kept" one felt like falling in the
dumps because his glad young life in the green mountains
was over to-day and because he had to march away,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
perhaps to a foreign country, perhaps to the distant battle-field,
and because he, who was as fond of life as another,
had to risk his young blood, the hurrahs of his boon
companions soon roused him to fresh tavern joys; and,
at last, all began to feel as though this were but one long
day, without an end to it, sinking into the night and the
night into wine.</p>

<p>But hours come and pass away; and so do drinking-bouts.
The next day we separated; and to Krieglach-Alpel
went what from Krieglach-Alpel came. Of our lot,
two men had become soldiers: a bloodless, but very
good-looking charcoal-burner's son; and a labourer. The
labourer put on a jovial and almost wild air and tried to
pick a quarrel with more than one stranger who greeted us
in the street. The charcoal-burner's son was steeped in
melancholy. We did not know what he was losing through
a military life, nor he either: he just gazed at the great
mountains and the glorious forest trees&hellip;.</p>

<p>We others and the inns on the road took all the greater
care to keep the mad recruiting-spirit alive. By the
custom of our fathers, the rosette and ribbons are worn
on the hat by the recruit who goes home a soldier and by
no other. But we acted differently that day: we all kept
our rosettes, so as to create a greater sensation and
compel respect.</p>

<p>"Look, look! Expect we'll be having war soon," said
many a little peasant, "for they're keeping them all now,
every man jack of them. It'll be true what the old folks
say, that the women will fight for the chair on which a
he once sat."</p>

<p>Beyond the village of Fressnitz we came up with a
beggar-man carrying a hurdy-gurdy on his back. One of
us at once demanded the use of it; and, while a second
led the old man like a bridle-horse, a third ground out
on the beggar-man's back all the tunes which the organ
contained; and we others danced and jumped about on
the frozen road. In this array, we arrived at Krieglach,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
where we took our musical team to the tavern with us.
The old man was in fine fettle and assured us that we
were angels of recruits compared with those of his day.
He had been one himself; and once they took a peasant
who was sitting in a cart, letting his donkey pull him uphill,
and harnessed him between the shafts and put the
donkey in the cart instead; and they had done saucier
things than that. He drank our healths and praised the
days of old.</p>

<p>There was lots of singing as we crossed the mountain
by the bridle-path. I should be sorry to repeat the songs.
We sang ourselves warm, we sang ourselves hoarse.
On the upper ridge, a hawker, known as Egg Mary, met
us, carrying to Mürzzuschlag her baskets filled with those
little things of which the songs says:</p>

<div class="poem-container">

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">It's an oval fortress,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has no towers, no portress<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But lordly food inside.</span>
</div>

</div>

<p>And the words came to my mouth:</p>

<p>"Raw eggs are good for hoarseness!"</p>

<p>"We'll make sure of that at once!" cried the others,
took the woman's basket and sucked out all her eggs&mdash;the
charcoal-burner's son with the rest of them&mdash;and I too.</p>

<p>All that Egg Mary could get out in her wrath was:</p>

<p>"You're a pack of scoundrels!"</p>

<p>"Never mind," answered Zedel-Zenz. "We'll pay as
soon as we have any money."</p>

<p>Then she went back with an empty basket, grumbling
and uttering her various views of us and our behaviour.
We started singing again, and the eggs did their duty.</p>

<p>At Stocker's inn we once more gave rein to our spirits.
I did not fail to renew my inquiries about my benefactress
with the ribbons and was firmly determined, if ever I
came across the girl, to love her with all my heart and
soul. The old hostess blinked significantly with her little
grey eyes, but I got nothing more out of her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>We lads parted outside the inn in the steadfast belief
that, after these days spent in one another's company,
we would remain the firmest of mutual friends. A farewell
feast was ordered of the innkeeper for the day when
the two who had been kept were to join the colours.</p>

<p>When the spree was over, I felt a sinking inside, as I
wended my way home. A laughing face looked out at me
from every window. My father walked slowly up to me
and knocked the hat off my head with his arm, so that
the ribbons rustled against the frozen snow. For the
moment I did not know what this meant; but my father
did not leave me long in ignorance.</p>

<p>"Is it all the same to you," he said, "that you come
home with a blazing lie on your hat? As to <em>who</em> gave
you that besom, we'll talk about that later. All I ask you
now is, how can you do a thing like that to your mother?
I dare say you don't know&mdash;you blackguard young
puppy you!&mdash;how her heart is torn with anxiety at the
thought of losing a child. But that you could give her
such a fright! I wouldn't have thought it of you! If
Egg Mary hadn't happened to come and tell us that
you had a lucky escape this time, you might have had a
nice business to answer for, with that damned rosette
of yours. And your mother so poorly this long while
past and all!"</p>

<p>I trembled in every limb. My recruiting giddiness
was gone; I suddenly saw my whole baseness. My
heart cried out for my mother. And that same Egg
Mary, whom we&mdash;not to mince matters&mdash;had robbed
on the high-road, had gone on ahead, in her good nature,
to tell my people, to whom she owed many a little kindness,
that they must not be frightened at the soldier's
favour with which I should most likely come home, and
that I had come out of it with luck.</p>

<p>My mother's joyful, loving grip of my hand only
deepened my contrition. But father was wagging the
rosette under my nose:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>"And now, boy, perhaps you'll be good enough to tell
me where you got those fine feathers from! Are you
walking out with somebody, young as you are? That's
what I want to know!"</p>

<p>Many and sweet as were the thoughts of pretty girls
that filled my mind, fond as I was of talking of it to
fellows like myself, the thing looked very different in
my father's presence. I assured him that I was walking
out with nobody and that I did not know who had given
me the favour. He laughed out loud and then flew at
me angrily because of "the silly impudence of trying to
make him believe a fib like that."</p>

<p>My mother interposed and said that they could rejoice
that I was home again, and that they must not begin by
scolding me so hard.</p>

<p>"Now you're backing him in his wickedness," he
cried, "when he's lying straight in my face! But did
you ever see such a booby as not to know from whom he
got the ribbons in his hat?"</p>

<p>"Now it's my turn to laugh," said my mother. "This
time the boy really can't tell, for <em>I</em> had the favour stuck
in his hat on the sly, so that he might have a bit of colour
about him, as good as the rest of them."</p>

<p>She had done it secretly, because she suspected that
her son was longing for a rosette from strange hands,
and could easily have despised his mother's gift. She
had prevented his ingratitude beforehand. And her
home-coming son might have smitten her to the heart
with that same rosette!&hellip;</p>

<p>The murder was out; father said nothing; and I &hellip;
I also did my share of thinking&hellip;.</p>

<p>That children must always be striving after strange
and far-away joys, hungering for love and yearning for
love, which they will never find so pure and rich and
endless as at home, in that perennial spring of tenderness,
their mother's heart!</p>

A Forgotten Land</h2>


<p class="cap4"><span class="upper">I always</span> say that the world is becoming too
small. There is no room left for hermits.</p>

<p>I frequently receive enquiries, from correspondents
abroad, for cool summer resorts,&mdash;for nature resorts.
Would I please&mdash;so runs the request&mdash;suggest a corner
in the Alps where they will find clean rooms and good
food in a farm-house kept by simple, kindly people.
Added conditions: no railway, no telegraph, no post,
no newspapers. A place where they can feel safe from
meeting English people or people from Berlin and&mdash;forgive
the imputation&mdash;Vienna. They want to have
nothing but woods and fields around them, and, oblivious
of all town luxuries and refinements, at least for a few
weeks to bathe body and soul in the dew of a primitive
life. This is the wish which&mdash;O curious sign of the times!&mdash;grows
ever louder and louder. Is the return to nature,
yearned for by the poets, at last beginning in earnest?</p>

<p>If only the company-promoters do not seize upon
this need and found a colony for hermits! It is not
so easy to recover nature once wantonly deserted.
Our alps contain no valley, however secluded, into
which artificial wines and brandy and American meat-extracts
and cigars have not by this time made their
way, in which the fences are bare of railway timetables<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
and mineral-water posters and upon which some
<i>News of the Day</i> or other does not force its huge weekly
doses of "culture" and information.</p>

<p>This is the case by now even in those districts whose
"unfavourable" situation has hitherto for the most
part spared them the two well-known "blessings"
of civilisation. The floodgates are opened; and even
those parts cannot be spared the deluge&hellip;.</p>

<p>My forgotten land! He who would still bathe for
a little in "the dew of a primitive life" may do so!
I hasten to draw a fleeting picture of the land and its
people before the floods of the world come and inundate
it.</p>

<p>The region is locally and colloquially known as Sanct-Jakobs-Land,
or "the Jackelland." It lies in Styria,
between the Mürzthal and the Wechsel mountain-chain.
Its river is the clear-running Feistritz, rich in
trout, with its countless tributaries. When one crosses
the top of the watershed over the Wechsel, or the Pfaffen,
or from the Mürzthal, everything at once wears a different
look. The mountains are lower, the forests more scattered,
because they are broken up on every hand by cornfields.
The farms lie isolated in the fields, on the skirts
of the forests, often very high in the mountains. In
the valley are the bright green pastures, with running
brooks and corn-mills. The air is calm and peaceful,
disturbed by the whistle of no locomotive, the chimney
of no factory. The old farm-houses are humbly built;
and the kitchen, living-room, hen-house and so on often
form but one general room. This makes the new sort
of houses, which are springing up on every side, look
all the grander, with their sundry apartments and
numerous windows,&mdash;from which many a pretty, fair-haired
face peeps out at us, for it is an event when a
stranger comes that way.</p>

<p>The farm premises are, for the most part, extensive,
built of wood, straw-thatched and enclosed within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
a plank fence. Every farm has its open-air crucifix,
often artistically carved, sometimes, I admit, adorned
with a figure of Christ which faith alone can save from
ridicule. On the spreading mountain-heights lie wide
forests, such as Teufelstein, Fischbacherwald, Vorauerwald,
Feistritzwald, Rabenwald. There are no work-houses,
except the few on the Wechsel. For the rest,
the region is well-populated and rich in compact villages
and beautiful churches. The mountain-village of St.
Jakob im Walde, which gives the Jakobsland its name,
lies on a spur of the Wechsel, some four thousand feet
above the level of the sea.</p>

<p>The inhabitants do not call themselves Jacklers:
they are only so-called by the people in the districts
round about; for the name does not stand for anything
very fine, though it has grown old in honour. They
simply call themselves after their parishes: the Rattners,
the St. Jakobers, the Miesenbachers and so on. Almost
every village has its own peculiarity. The Kathreiner
goes in for finery, the Rattner for disputes and litigation;
the Wenigzeller is a great man for backbiting and
quarrelling; the Fischbacher is a notorious brawler.</p>

<p>The people are powerfully built and have tall and
slender figures; they are mostly fair-haired. The men
wear clothes of dark stuff, in the summer, and, in winter,
the so-called <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wilfling</i>, a mixture of thread and sheep's
wool; on workdays they tie on long blue aprons, a practice
which prevails even among the schoolboys. The women
favour a bunchy style of dress; and when one of them
wants to look particularly smart (and this applies to
many), she puts on three, or five, or more petticoats,
one over the other. Many villages are already infected
with the fashion of dress introduced from the Mürzthal.</p>

<p>A peculiarity of the Jackler is his love for flax, which
he cultivates in great quantities; and the hackling,
in autumn, gives rise to regular popular festivals. <i>During
the winter, both men and women occupy themselves in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
spinning, and do so until late at night, passing the time as
they work in telling stories, asking and guessing conundrums,
and singing.</i> Only there is no spinning after supper on
Thursdays: from flax spun at such a time the weaver
weaves shrouds.</p>

<p>Their food is simple and consists mainly of milk,
flour, pulse, potatoes and linseed-oil. The everyday
beverage is new cider. In some places they grind dried
pears, and from the flour thus produced, which is mixed
into a pulp with milk, they make the so-called <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Dalken</i>.
Apples are also dried; and so are plums and cherries:
these are all made into soup in the winter. The cattle
are reared, fattened and sold; sheep or pigs are slaughtered
for holiday needs. The fare is very rich on feast-days;
and there is a tradition that, on Twelfth Night, nine
different kinds of stews should be consumed in every
house: formerly the Jacklers used to eat no fewer than
three meals on that night, so that "Three Kings' Night"<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16" href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
is known as "Three Meal Night" to this day.</p>

<p>The population, which reminds one, in its habits
and customs, of the inhabitants of the Böhmerwald,
is descended from Bajuvar stock and immigrated
in the sixth and seventh centuries. It is German by
origin and German by nature. Settled here for over
a thousand years, the individual members of this race
have become so rooted to the soil that they never leave
it, and only with difficulty admit anything foreign to
the land. The cell of the first German monk who began
to convert the heathen is said to have stood in the
desert where the little village of Mönichwald now stands.
The mission was afterwards continued by the monasteries
of Vorau and Pöllau. The living is in the possession of
the population to this day; in many places, the parish-priest
fills at the same time the offices of parish-councillor,
guardian of the poor and district school-inspector.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>One can easily, therefore, picture the peace that reigns
between church, school and municipality. Generally
speaking, the clergy&mdash;in the absence of any defiant
antagonism&mdash;are more liberal-minded here than in those
outlying districts where they feel called upon to defend
their compromised rule by the exercise of intolerance
and severity.</p>

<p>The Jackler is favourably distinguished in one particular
from the agricultural population of some other parts: he is
not neutral. In the surrounding districts the peasant is
apt to be indifferent towards matters of religious practice
and equally indifferent towards other ideals and spiritual
things. The Jackler is not like that. Gorgeous festivals,
which he loves to celebrate in his stately village-churches,
festivals which remind one of the Tyrol in their splendour,
their often dramatic form, their mediæval love of God
and veneration of the saints, delight him, stimulate
him, give sustenance and substance to his spiritual life.
A priest who is not prepared to celebrate the anniversaries
of the church's patrons with due pomp and ceremony
and to invite half a dozen neighbouring priests to read
Mass and preach (and he must provide them with a good
dinner into the bargain) would soon find himself at
loggerheads with his flock.</p>

<p>The district is often visited by fanatical missionaries,
who promptly arouse excitement for miles around. The
parish-priest is not always filled with the friendliest
feelings towards these hunters of souls, but he has to
invite them for fear of offending his superiors. The
costs of the mission are more than gladly covered by
the parishioners.</p>

<p>The Jackler is notable not only for his pious tendencies,
but also for his business subtlety; and he will swindle
his parish-priest over a deal in oxen, to-day, after being
moved to tears by his sermon yesterday&mdash;and this
without the least prejudice to his own religious sentiments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>"If I can't cheat my best friend," says the Wenigzeller,
"whom <em>can</em> I cheat? My enemy doesn't trust me!"</p>

<p>The so-called lesser "holidays," of which there are
over thirty in the year, are also conscientiously kept:
in the morning, by a sung Mass in church; in the afternoon,
in the tavern or on the bowling-green. Many
servants work on those days on their own account;
and, if their employer needs their services, he must
pay them a special wage.</p>

<p>The Jackler is quick in his work and moderate and
discreet in his pleasures. There are rich and poor in
this region as in others, but not in the ordinary sense.
The householder is "rich" who is not in debt in respect
of his real or movable estate; "rich" is applied to the
carrier who has saved a little silver, to a farm-girl who
has flax and linen in her trunk and perhaps hides a savings-bank
book beneath it, with the amount of her reaping
pay. "Poor" are the debt-ridden cottager, the landlord
whose property is mortgaged up to the hilt, the incompetent
salter or pickler. No one is ruined by privation:
people, it is true, are often harsh to the poor man, but
they help him.</p>

<p>Nearly everything that the peasant needs is produced
by his industry; there is little ready-money in the district;
but, for that reason, it has two or three times the value
as compared with the prices ruling in the railway districts.</p>

<p>"A thousand gulden!"</p>

<p>That expresses their utmost conception of wealth.
The occasional stranger who happens to have strayed
into this region is surprised when he finds himself charged
no more than eighty kreuzer for a good night's lodging
and an excellent supper and breakfast. On the other
hand, when a Jackler, for once in a way, travels on the
railway, his wonder never ceases at the high fares which
he is called upon to pay; and he considers that the
shorter time the train takes to cover a distance, the
less the charge should be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>The inhabitants of the Feistritz district supply the
Mürzthal with poultry, eggs and fruit at a very cheap
rate; and the women who carry and deliver them earn
barely twenty kreuzer a day. Wood and coal also find
their way into that ravenous and industrious valley;
and the Jackler artisans make their bit of money there.
They have the making of good masons, carpenters,
shoemakers, tailors, smiths, watchmakers, gunsmiths
and so on. These workmen from the Jackelland are
greatly appreciated in the Mürzthal and round about;
they work hard, well and cheaply, and are not particular
in the matter of board and lodging.</p>

<p>Many maid-servants, who enter a farmer's service
for a year at Christmas, do so for a trifling annual wage
of fifteen or twenty gulden. On the other hand, they
stipulate with their employers that, in summer, when
there is hardly any pressing work to be done at home,
they shall be allowed to follow their own business for
a few weeks. The lasses then go reaping. In the month
of June they wander away, with bundle and sickle,
to the lowlands or the Mürzthal, where the corn is ripe
early; and they find plenty of work and amaze everybody
by their eager and indefatigable diligence. This
done, they cheerfully come home again with their reaping
wages and once more apply themselves briskly to the
needs of field and garden. It is very seldom that one
of them, lured by love or other worldly advantages,
remains away; they like home best, where they form
part, so to speak, of the family of their employer, with
whom maid and man alike live on fraternal terms.</p>

<p>A fine characteristic of this little land is the cohesion
that reigns among neighbours. If one of them is visited
with misfortune, the others stand by him fairly and
squarely; do his urgent work for him, if he be ill; come
to his aid with building materials, carpenters and masons,
if fire or water have destroyed his house; send in food
as well; and generally put the sorely-tried one on his legs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
once more. Again, in certain forms of labour, such as
copse-cutting, flax-scutching, corn-mowing, they gladly
work for the common cause&mdash;on this farm to-day,
on that to-morrow&mdash;with the result that everything
goes sociably and cheerfully. One for all and all for
one!</p>

<p>The young lads stick together for their particular
objects. They form clubs&mdash;each district according to
its own requirements&mdash;through which they mutually
support one another in their feuds and love-adventures.
They help and protect one another in "window-haunting"
and "street-strolling," as the nocturnal love-walks are
called; they humbug the father, when one of them is
after the pretty daughter; they help to defeat the rivals;
and, in addition, they play all sorts of practical jokes,
which their brains are very quick at inventing. The
youth of one parish will often hatch deliberate plots
against that of another; and bloody fights take place
on many a Sunday and holiday.</p>

<p>Amorous relations between unengaged couples do
not, as yet, occur to the same extent in the Jackelland
as elsewhere; morals are stricter, opportunities fewer
and frivolity less marked. Manners, upon the whole,
are more serious and sober, a fact which is in no way
detrimental to the pleasure of living, but, on the contrary,
increases it and keeps it fresh and clean.</p>

<p>The lover of a healthy and intelligent people must
needs feel himself at home and stimulated in the Jackelland.
When, on a Sunday, he sits among the peasants
in the Tafés, or inns run by the church, he will not be
bored; he will rather be soon inclined to join in the
conversation. But the stranger&mdash;if he think for a
moment that he is ruling the talk&mdash;must be on his guard
lest he be made a butt of! They have at their command
an exceedingly witty and subtle form of ridicule, which
often is understood only by the natives themselves.
Many a townsman who has tried to preach wisdom to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
the Jacklers has been delightfully hoaxed by them and
ultimately laughed out of court.</p>

<p>Place-hunting, party-hatred, pessimism and such-like
flowers of our time have not yet blossomed in the
Jackelland. The people there are people in whom hard
bodily labour rouses no complaint, in whom pleasure
is not marred by a subsequent reaction, people whose
life, usually a long one, is spent peacefully, rich in great
toils and small sins. Thanks to their moderation and
contentment, they are free lords, who can easily make
fun of others who have fettered themselves in the chains
of worldly advancement.</p>

<p>The only sinister inhabitants are the civil engineers,
who for years have been exploring the length and breadth
of the little land, in the hope of sooner or later turning
the iron horse to graze in those green pastures.</p>

The Schoolmaster</h2>


<p class="cap2"><span class="upper">It</span> was getting dark; the autumn mists were sinking
over the wooded mountains. The herdsman was
trudging his way home to the tinkling bells of his cattle.
For some time longer the farm-hand was heard beating
the oat-stalks over a beam that lay on the threshing-floor,
until the last grain was separated. The barn door closed
at last; and the little houseful of people gathered in
the parlour to eat their rye soup and potato mash. Then
they betook themselves to their straw beds.</p>

<p>The children were soon asleep.</p>

<p>A rushlight burnt in the room, and the farmer's wife
kept putting it straight on its spike. Peter wound up
the smoke-browned clock on the wall.</p>

<p>Just as husband and wife were about to get into bed,
the watch-dog in the yard began to bark. There came
a light tapping at the window-pane.</p>

<p>"Who's that?" cried the farmer.</p>

<p>And his wife added crossly:</p>

<p>"There's no peace for us to-day!"</p>

<p>"It's someone begging for a night's shelter," said a
hoarse voice outside.</p>

<p>"I expect it's a poor man," said the farmer's wife.
"That's quite a different thing. Go and unbolt the
door, Peter."</p>

<p>Soon after a man stumbled into the room, weary and
bent, grasping a long stick in his right hand and carrying
a little bundle in his left. A wide-brimmed, discoloured,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
crushed felt hat was on his head, and under the brim
hung snow-white strands of hair.</p>

<p>Peter took the rush in his hand and threw a light upon
the stranger's face. Then he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Heavens! It can't be possible&mdash;&mdash;! Why, it's the
schoolmaster of Rattenstein!"</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, my dear Heath&mdash;Peter," said the old man,
recovering his breath, "that's so. With your permission,
I will sit down at once."</p>

<p>The farmer's wife pulled on her dress again and hurried
into the kitchen to warm some soup; then she called
back into the parlour:</p>

<p>"Go and light a candle, Peter. The rush won't burn
properly, and the smoke makes one's eyes fairly smart."</p>

<p>Then, when a tallow candle was burning on the table
and the old man had wiped the sweat from his careworn
face, Heath Peter almost shyly offered him his hand and
said:</p>

<p>"Well, how do you come wandering into the Wilderness
like this, Schoolmaster?"</p>

<p>"It had to be," replied the old man. "It's a case,
with me, of 'Forsaken and beat, like the stones in the
street.' I just turned up a footpath and went on over
hill and dale as the Lord willed. And so, in the end, I
came to you people in the Wilderness."</p>

<p>"And, if I may ask, where do you mean to go,
Schoolmaster?"</p>

<p>The old man made no reply. His head sank down
upon his chest. His fingers clutched at his blue handkerchief;
but, before he could raise it with trembling hand
to his face, he burst into heavy sobs.</p>

<p>"Lord Jesus! Schoolmaster!" cried Peter, springing
to support him, for the old man threatened to collapse.</p>

<p>"Never would I have thought," he sobbed at last,
"that such an hour as this would come to me in my old
days. God above, Thou knowest, that I have not deserved
it!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>"There must have been some great misfortune," the
farmer said. "But Schoolmaster must not take it
too much to heart. And if there is anything I can do
he must let me know."</p>

<p>"God bless you, Heath Peter! You are a good soul,
and I've known you this many a long day: why, it must
be nigh on five-and-thirty years. It was I pushed back your
little bonnet when the priest christened you. Ah me,
if the same priest were only still alive! He was a good
man, indeed, and would not have discharged me like a
day-labourer at the end of his day's work, no, not though
I <em>did</em> ring ten bells for Louis the herdsman. True, I'm
old now, and can't look after the school as I used to.
Also I can't get accustomed to the new church government.
You know how the new provisor called me a
prophet of Beelzebub? I knew that I had done nothing
wrong, for all that, and went on holding my extra classes.
Lastly, you also must have heard that poor crazy Louis
the herdsman took his own life lately. The provisor refused
to have the passing-bell tolled for the poor wretch; and
then the dead man's mother came to me&mdash;for I am
sacristan as well&mdash;and begged me, for God's sake, to
toll the bell for her son. Louis had always been an
upright man; the old woman had all her life long
thought the world of a Christian burial-bell; and my
soul was filled with pity for her when she cried so
bitterly. Then thought I to myself, 'The provisor has
gone to see a colleague at Grosshöfen, so I will take it
upon myself and, as she asks me to do it for God's sake,
I will ring the bells: surely it's the best consolation we
can offer the poor woman in her distress.' Louis was buried
in the ditch where they found him; and, when the bells
rang out, the mother ran to the grave and said an Our
Father for his soul. The provisor did not hear the bells
nor the prayer, and he didn't feel the sorrow nor the
joy of that mother's heart either; but folks' tongues told
him all about the bell-ringing. Yesterday, as I was helping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
him on with his chasuble, he gave me a smile, and I thought,
'Aye, the provisor is a good enough gentleman, after all;
and I shall get on with him well enough!' Thereupon
I went off to collect my corn dues from the farmers.
(The people are well disposed toward me, and look after
me finely: I did not have to buy a single slice of bread for
myself all last winter!) It's a couple of hard days'
work for one like me; but that's nothing&mdash;who wouldn't
willingly cart away a heap of stones if he knew there was
a treasure underneath? It had begun to grow dusk
when I reached the village with my last load. Then, as
I stood outside my door and was taking the key from my
pocket and looking forward to my rest, I said to myself,
'Goodness, what's that? Who's been having a game
with me?' The lock was sealed up. I put down my
load to have a closer look at the thing. Yes, Peter,
I was quite right, the school-house was sealed against me
with the parish seal. 'Well,' I thought to myself, 'this
<em>is</em> a pretty business!' I threw down my carrier and ran
to the presbytery, which is now also the municipal
offices. I called out for the provisor. 'Not at home,'
cries the housekeeper, tells me to look under the stone-heap
if I have lost anything, and slams the door in my
face. Then the blood rushed to my heart."</p>

<p>The old man was nearly choking, and the words came
half stifled from his throat.</p>

<p>"But I did not remain standing outside the presbytery
door, and I did not knock either. I ran down to the
stone-heap, and there I found my Sunday washing, my
black coat, and my fiddle. And in between the strings
was a little tiny bit of paper. Well, here it is; you can
read it, Heath Peter."</p>

<p>"So I would, and gladly," said Heath Peter civilly,
"but there's just this about it, that I don't know one
letter from another."</p>

<p>"Well, well, in that case reading would certainly be
a miracle," said the schoolmaster. "However, sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
it's better not to know how to read. Here's what
the note says to the old man that I am: 'We sincerely
regret to have to make the following communication to
you in the name of the honourable Consistory and of
the local parish. Whereas you, Michel Bieder, school
teacher in the aforesaid parish, have repeatedly, in the
instruction of the youth entrusted to your care, acted
contrary to the regulations, and whereas, but recently,
you took it upon yourself, in an unprecedented manner,
on your own responsibility, to perform an ecclesiastical
function, and this, moreover, in favour of a suicide, so
now take note and be it known to you that we have
relieved you of your post. Given at the presbytery at
Rattenstein.'"</p>

<p>The old man ceased.</p>

<p>Peter snuffed the candle in great perplexity, and then
said:</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Schoolmaster, you might have known that
it does not do to toll everyone promiscuous-like into the
grave. That much would have occurred even to me,
Heath Peter."</p>

<p>"And so there I sat upon the stone-heap, and I wanted
nothing to make me a complete beggar but a stick and
wallet. The stars were out by this time, and an owl
hooting in the forest was hooting at me it seemed. Then
I did not know what to do. There I was cast out, a
poor old man, that had buried a parish and christened
one. So I lay down upon the stone-heap and my white
hairs were wet with dew. And the church clock ticked
just like a bird pecking the naked grains in a field in
autumn, that clock ticked away second after second from
the little bit left of my life. 'Tick on, tick on, you
honest pendulum,' thought I. 'It's late.' And then,
suddenly, I wondered, 'Who will ring the vesper-bell
to-night?' I darted up and on, over the mound, to the
church, and into the belfry, took hold of the ropes,
and rang all the bells at once. And that was my farewell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
to my dear church and to the congregation. I should
have liked to wake the dead in their graves and tell
them all about my unfair treatment. But they slept on
in peace, while I rang in my beggarhood. Then I cut
myself a stick from the bushes by the churchyard walls
and went on and on. Oh, I can walk right enough still!
It took me barely three hours here to the Wilderness."</p>

<p>The old man bent his head and held his hand before
his eyes.</p>

<p>"What nonsense!" said the farmer's wife, who had
been standing some time by the table with the soup-plate
in her hand. "And you are going up to the wilds next,
Schoolmaster?"</p>

<p>"Must I go to the wilds?" cried the old schoolmaster.
"God! what should I do in that stony place?"</p>

<p>He hid his face again.</p>

<p>"'It's a proper cross, and no Lord upon it,' says the
old proverb. And the old proverb's right," said the
wife. "Only eat your soup now, in Heaven's name,
Schoolmaster, and get some warmth into your poor body.
God will put things straight; don't let that fret you.
I say, Peter, come into the kitchen for a minute; I
want you to shut the chimney-slide; I can't quite
manage it."</p>

<p>But it was nothing to do with the chimney-slide, really.</p>

<p>When the pair were in the kitchen the wife said:</p>

<p>"You must see, Peter, that we can't let the schoolmaster
go like this. I went to him for schooling, and he
taught me to use my Prayer Book. As long as I live I
should never relish a morsel of bread again if I had to
say to myself, 'Your old teacher's had to go a-begging!'&mdash;What
would you say to having the top room
fitted up for him? He could cut the rushes for us in the
winter; and he could look after the children in the
summer, when we were out in the fields; and he could
teach them a bit too. You see, it would be just as well
if they knew how to read a little, and the boy would love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
it so and writing too; and I shan't rest content till he
can write his name."</p>

<p>"There's no need for that, Klara," answered
Peter. "Who is there in the Wilderness that knows
how to write his name? Not a soul. Besides, working
men's hands are too rough for that kind of thing; and,
if it comes to a pinch, we can always make our cross."</p>

<p>Whereupon his wife:</p>

<p>"After that, I don't wonder that we have so many
crosses to bear in the Wilderness! But I don't hold with
it, and I think that with the schoolmaster's help we
might rise a bit."</p>

<p>"You're looking at only one side of the question.
You know quite well that we only grow enough corn to
make a bushel and a half, and that we have no milk and
no bacon in the winter; you know that we have no meat
in the larder, that we have no proper bedding, and that
we are poor all round, in every nook and corner. And
now you want to take the schoolmaster in as well! There
can't be any question of it, good wife."</p>

<p>And she:</p>

<p>"Well, if you're beginning to grieve about the bit of
bread and the morsel of bacon which the schoolmaster
would eat, I'll save it out of my own mouth, and lie on
the bare straw, in Heaven's name, and think it an honour
if I can have the old teacher under my roof."</p>

<p>And he:</p>

<p>"Yes; and by the time you've done you'll sew a
beggar's sack for him and one for me and one for yourself,
and we'll fasten the children on to each other's backs."</p>

<p>"Because you have no trust in the Lord!" answered
the farmer's wife, a little nettled. "My mother always
used to say, 'Every good action done on earth is engraved
by the angels in heaven on God's golden throne.' But
I am beginning to think that you can't want to see <em>your</em>
name there."</p>

<p>"Who <em>has</em> nothing can <em>give</em> nothing," said Peter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
resignedly. "How can it help a beggar-man if I offer
him an empty hand?"</p>

<p>"Well, he can take hold of it and have a support."</p>

<p>"Go on! One <em>must</em> look to one's own children
first and not to strangers. And, lastly, we should most
likely get into trouble with the priest; and how would
that suit you?"</p>

<p>"You're a regular old silly, that's what you are!"
cried the wife, and banged a saucepan on the stove till it
rang again. "It wants a special grace of God to argue
with you. How glad you would be if one day your
guardian angel came and said to God, 'Here is Heath
Peter, who was good to the poor; and he also took the
unfortunate schoolmaster of Rattenstein into his house
and looked after him and cared for him in his old age,
but he did it for love of Thee, O God our Father, and
therefore do Thou mercifully forgive him, if he had
other faults, and lead him into Thy heaven, and his
children with him and his wife as well!' Wouldn't you
be glad, Peter, if that ever happened?"</p>

<p>Peter had been scratching his head a little, and, at
last, he answered in a softer voice:</p>

<p>"You're shouting so loud you'll wake the children,
and the schoolmaster himself will hear.&mdash;You can keep
him for all that I care; I say no more."</p>

<p>There was not much to be done with Peter with arguments
based on worldly logic; you could say white or
black, but he invariably followed his own nose. But his
wife knew him inside and out, as well as she knew her
own nightcap; she took a higher standpoint, and when,
in her clever way of talking, she held up heaven and God
before him, he came kneeling, as people say, to the cross&mdash;to
the matrimonial cross.</p>

<p>When the couple returned to the parlour Klara said:</p>

<p>"One would think that chimney-slide wasn't meant
to be reached; one has to stand on tip-toe to get at it.
Well, don't you like your soup, Schoolmaster? I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
did my best to make it good, and I put plenty of caraway
seeds in it, against the cramp. Ah! and now there's
something else to discuss. I don't know what's come
into my Peter's head, but he wants to keep you in the
house, here and now, Schoolmaster, so that you can
teach our children a bit of reading! What I said was,
'Schoolmaster won't stay with us. A man like that,'
said I, 'has something better to do. Even if we were to
fit up the top room for him and wait upon him as an
honoured guest, he wouldn't stay with us.&mdash;And then
we can't give him any school fees,' I said, 'and only
such poor fare as we have ourselves.&mdash;If that's enough
for him, I shall be delighted if he will stay.'"</p>

<p>The old man rose from his seat and, in a voice of deep
emotion, said:</p>

<p>"Oh, you dear, good people! As you yourselves were
the first to suggest it, I now venture to implore you. I
have nowhere to go, and I hardly dare risk myself in the
wilds. Only give me a roof over my head and a spoonful of
soup for a few days and I will go back again to Rattenstein
and start my entreaties. The people will take pity on me;
and surely the parish provisor will not be stony-hearted."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't throw myself on his mercy exactly, that
I wouldn't," said the farmer's wife. "And Heath Peter
here was thinking that it would be all right, and that you
had better make the house on the heath your home,
Schoolmaster, as long as the Lord does not order
things differently."</p>

<p>Then little Gabriel suddenly called out something in
his sleep.</p>

<p>"There, the child's got the nightmare!" said Klara.</p>

<p>And she went to the little bed and, with her thumb,
made the sign of the cross on the boy's forehead.</p>

<p>Peter fixed up a bed in the barn for his guest to sleep
in that night; and soon all was dark and silent in the
house on the heath.</p>

<p class="cap2"><span class="upper">Heidepeter's</span><a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18" href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> house was the very last in the
Wilderness. It stood on the heath where the
forests began, lying very high on a piece of almost level
ground. The grey stones showed through the grass in
many places before the house.</p>

<p>Upon the heath lay numberless rocks patched and
traceried with moss. Here and there on the sandy
ground between the rocks stood a silver-birch tree whose
leaves were for ever whispering and trembling, until in
late autumn they were blown away and lost over the
moor.</p>

<p>This moorland house bore upon the king-post of the
big living-room the date 1744; it was the first house
ever built in the Wilderness.</p>

<p>Peter's forefathers must have been well-to-do, for they
possessed much forest and were cattle-breeders as well.
The trees had all been cut down and had grown up again,
but now Count Frohn&mdash;who possessed a fine castle, the
Frohnburg, on the other side of the hill, and, neighbouring
the heath, a great deal of forest and its hunting, and
hitherto a feudal right to the peasants' service&mdash;was
gradually possessing himself of the squatters' forest as
well; so that it had now come to this&mdash;that without his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
permission no tree might be felled nor branch broken.
The poor outlying folk of the Wilderness were neglected
by all the authorities and courts of justice&mdash;indeed,
almost forgotten. So they clung to their grain-growing&mdash;to
the scanty husbandry possible to the place.</p>

<p>To the moorland house was now left only the steep
fields sloping down to the ravine, and a narrow strip of
meadow. Everything else, such as rights of wood and
pasture, was heavily burdened with taxation and feudal
duty.</p>

<p>On the weather-stained wooden wall of the house,
facing north, and beneath the deep, overhanging roof,
was the figure of an animal, carved out of wood. Any
stranger, when now and again such a one passed by the
house on his wanderings among the mountains, came to
a halt before this thing and gazed at it. Pedlars with
their packs, Carniolas with sieves and all manner of
wooden wares, glass-cutters, old-clothes men, who were
always glad to go about the Wilderness in summer-time,
would prop their back burdens against their sticks and
have a good look at the figure before they entered the
house. Even the beggars did the same, with a benevolent
expression on their faces, as if admiring the man who had
carved it.</p>

<p>But as to what the object represented opinions were
very various. One said it was a cow, another a donkey,
another a chamois; some, however, said it must be a
stag. This last supposition was well founded. From the
creature's head protruded two little bits of wood, notched
saw-like on top, which just conceivably stood for the
antlers. Heidepeter was very decided about the matter:
the animal really was a stag.</p>

<p>All sorts of sayings and proverbs about the stag had
become bound up with the household life inside the walls.</p>

<p>When Peter said to his little son Gabriel, "Laddie, we
must hunt the red stag to-morrow!" he meant nothing
else than that the child must get up at sunrise next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
morning. The stag was always glowing red at that
hour.</p>

<p>When the wind blew from the north the figure beat its
feet upon the wall, and the people inside would say,
"The stag is knocking again; there'll be a change in
the weather."</p>

<p>Through one whole summer Gabriel had been watching
how two sparrows built their nest between the wooden
antlers. (At that time a new bird's nest was the greatest
joy on earth to Gabriel.) He could no longer resist the
temptation, leant a ladder against the wall, and was
going to climb up. Then, by chance, his father came
along, and he, usually so mild, gave the boy quite unmistakably
to understand that he must, once and for all,
leave the stag in peace.</p>

<p>About this carved figure there clung a curious memory
for Heidepeter.</p>

<p>While still in the early days of his married life there
came some bad years, and there in the Wilderness nothing
would grow or ripen save turnips and cabbage. Rye and
oats started hopefully enough in the spring, greening
and gathering strength for an output of ears. Then, in
the heart of summer, came rain and cold, and the mists
hung about the hills for weeks. The corn grew pale and
stooped, as if it would rather creep back into the sheltering
soil. There followed a few weeks of sunshine after
that, but before even the grain could mature the snow
had fallen. And so it happened several years running.</p>

<p>The people lost heart and hardly cared to sow in the
following spring, or had no seed to sow with.</p>

<p>And Peter's grain-chest became empty, and he was
unable to lend his neighbours seed, as he used to; indeed,
he was barely able to provide for his own household.
But he was not discouraged, for he had a young, careful,
industrious wife in the house&mdash;a happy state of things
which will always render bad years more bearable.</p>

<p>His wife had proposed that they should grow more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
turnips than usual, and a big plot of cabbages, to make
up to some extent for the lack of grain. Peter followed
her counsel, and by June new beautiful seedlings were
set out. In July down came the rain and mist on the
Wilderness again, but the garden stuff went on slowly,
steadily growing.</p>

<p>During the raw days Clara stayed a good deal within
doors, because Peter, mindful of her condition, would
not have her out in the cold. But one day he came to
her room, saying:</p>

<p>"I don't know what it means, Clara; there must have
been some animal about&mdash;a whole row of the best cabbages
has been eaten."</p>

<p>The farm-hand said he had that morning seen a
stag running from the kitchen-garden towards the
forest.</p>

<p>Heidepeter set to work and heightened the wooden
paling round the garden. When, very soon after, he saw
Count Frohn crossing the field with his gun and gilded
powder-horn and proudly curving cock's feather, he
called to him, "Your honour, I humbly beg pardon&mdash;but
there's a stag that's always coming out of the forest, and
he'll eat up all our cabbages."</p>

<p>"Indeed?" answered the huntsman, laughing, and
whistled to his dogs and went on.</p>

<p>A night or two later the beast came again and ate a
whole row of cabbages. And so the next time Peter met
the Count he said, for the second time, and with his hat
under his arm, "I hope your honour won't be angry
with me&mdash;but I've no help for it, save this. There's
been so many bad seasons, and we've hardly anything
left to eat. Please rid us of that stag, for he's eating
up our food-stuff, leaf and root and all."</p>

<p>"Aha!" remarked the Count facetiously. "You'd
prefer eating the stag with your cabbages to that, wouldn't
you, eh?"</p>

<p>He whistled to his dog and went on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>Quite downhearted, Peter went home, sat down on the
bench, and for some time did not say anything. Suddenly
he struck his fist upon the table and sprang up.
Before he went out again, however, he went to his wife
and said quietly:</p>

<p>"Clara, I'm the sort of man that people can twist
round their finger&mdash;they call me a milksop; but it may be
I'm going to pick a quarrel for once. Don't you take on
about it. I thought it'd never have to come to this, but
now I see quite plain that it must."</p>

<p>Then he went out and made the garden fence higher
still, and plaited thorns in and out, and chained the house-dog
at the corner of the garden.</p>

<p>But the stag still came and ate the cabbages.</p>

<p>Then Heidepeter got up, and took the road under his
feet, and climbed over the steep slope until he came to
Castle Frohnburg on the other side of the mountain.
There a great shooting party were assembled, noblemen
and gentlemen, and all drinking out of foaming beakers
"Good luck to the sportsman!"</p>

<p>Peter strode through the midst of them and right up
to his master. He seemed like another man than himself
to-day. "I must defend my bread, sir," he said in a
stifled voice; "but so that I mayn't do any wrong, I've
come all this way to tell you I'm going to shoot the
stag."</p>

<p>Then the Count roared with laughter and called
out:</p>

<p>"You little fool! why do you put yourself to the
trouble?" He whistled for his two bulldogs. Heidepeter
said never another word, but went away. And
that night he shot the stag.</p>

<p>Early next morning the huntsmen came to his house
and clapped irons on his hands. He suffered this quietly,
and said to his inconsolable wife:</p>

<p>"Don't you take on about it&mdash;don't you take on.
The Lord will come and do justice yet!" And so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
Peter was taken away and thrown into prison as a
poacher.</p>

<p>Week after week he sat there. He was thinking neither
about his cabbages, nor the stag, nor the Count, but only
about his wife. "Perhaps her hour will come to-morrow,
perhaps even to-day, and thy wife is giving thee thy
first-born. She is holding him out to thee, but thou dost
not hold out thy arms to take him! Or there may be
some difficulty about the sponsors, and thou art not by
her side to help her in her great need; and when thou
returnest to thy house thou wilt find a mother without
her child, or an orphan&mdash;or perhaps neither mother nor
child"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>In his anguish he could have dashed his head against
the wall, but he remained quiet, only constantly
murmuring to himself as he stared at the brick
floor:</p>

<p>"The life of a man is a wheel. To-day I'm down and
you're up; to-morrow it's the other way about. Yes,
Count Frohn, round and rolling&mdash;that's how God has
made this world!"</p>

<p>At last, when his time was up, Heidepeter was set free.
He hurried to his home, and found his wife and child
both doing well.</p>

<p>The very next day he went into his workshop and
planed and carved a stag out of some boards. And this
he nailed to the weather-stained grey wooden wall of his
house in everlasting remembrance.</p>

<p>The dwellers of the Wilderness had by now come to
respect the determined Heidepeter, because he had been
brave enough to tackle the old devil&mdash;as they called the
Count under their breath; they had never expected this
of the good-natured man. It was, however, the first and
last time it happened: Peter saw there was nothing
to be gained that way, and the burden of years and
oppression took the heart out of him. He came to the
conclusion this world is a valley of sorrow, and who can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
better it? The reasonablest thing is to endure. He no
longer opposed himself to the Count; indeed, he used to
say it was better to suffer wrong than do wrong. And
he went on in his own quiet way, and the people,
because of his gentle, submissive bearing, called him
a milksop.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19" href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

Forest-Lily in the Snow</h2>

<p class="center inc ma-bot2">(A chapter from <cite>The Forest Schoolmaster</cite>)</p>


<p class="cap5"><span class="upper">A load</span> is off our hearts. The storm has fallen. A
soft wind came and gently relieved the trees of
their burdens. There were a few mild days; then the
snow settled and we can now go where we will with
snow-shoes.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, something has happened lately over in
the Karwässer. Berthold, whose family increases from
year to year, and from year to year has less to eat&mdash;Berthold
has turned poacher. A wood-cutter is a better
hand at this than any of us, who remain faint-hearted
humbugs all our lives long.&mdash;Poor people need not marry,
says the wood-cutter. Well, according to custom and
practice, they have not married, but they have kneeled
before me in the forest &hellip; and &hellip; and now they are
all starving together.</p>

<p>So Berthold has turned poacher. Wood-cutting brings
in far too little for a roomful of children. I send them all
the food I can, but it is not enough. He must have good,
strong soup for the ailing wife and a piece of meat for the
children; so he shoots the roe that comes his way. To
this, then, has passion brought him, until Berthold, who
once, as a herd, was such a good and jolly fellow, has,
through poverty, pride, and the love of his own, grown
into a pretty criminal.</p>

<p>I have once already pleaded with the gamekeeper for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
God's sake to be a little, just a little lenient with the poor
husband and father: he was sure to mend his ways, I
said, and I would go bail for him. Up to the present he
has not mended his ways; but the events of these wild
winter days have made him weep aloud, for he loves his
Lily-of-the-Forest above everything.</p>

<p>It happened on a murky winter evening. The little
windows are walled up with moss; outside new flakes are
falling on the old snow. Berthold is sitting up with the
children and with his sick Aga, only waiting until the
eldest girl, Lily, comes back with the milk which she has
gone to beg of a neighbouring hermit on the Hinterkar.
For the goats at home have been killed and eaten; and,
if only Lily would return, Berthold means to go into the
forest with his gun. For the roe cannot be far to seek in
this weather.</p>

<p>But it grows dark and Lily does not return. The snow
falls thicker and heavier, night draws in and Lily does not
come. The children by now are crying for their milk;
the father is eager to be after his game; the mother sits
up in bed:</p>

<p>"Lily!" she calls. "Wherever are you, child, trotting
about in that pitch-dark forest? Come home!"</p>

<p>How can the sick woman's weak voice reach the
wanderer through the fierce snowstorm?</p>

<p>As the night grows darker and stormier, Berthold's
craving to go poaching grows deeper, while his fears for
his Lily-of-the-Forest rise higher and higher. She is a
frail little twelve-year-old girl. True, she knows the
precipices and the wooded mountain-paths; but the
paths are hidden by the snow and the precipices by the
darkness.</p>

<p>At last, the man leaves his house to go in search of his
child. For hours he roams and shouts through the storm-swept
wilderness; the wind fills his eyes and mouth with
snow; he has to put forth all his strength to get back to
his hut.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>And now two days pass. The snow keeps on falling;
Berthold's hut is almost snowed in. They do their noisy
best to console themselves: Lily is sure to be at the
hermit's. This hope is destroyed on the third day, when
Berthold, after struggling for hours over the snow-clad
landscape, succeeds in reaching the hermitage. True,
Lily was at the hermit's three days ago, but left early on
her way home with the milk-pot.</p>

<p>"Then my Lily-of-the-Forest lies buried in the snow,"
says Berthold.</p>

<p>Whereupon he goes to other wood-cutters and begs,
as no one has ever seen this man beg before, that they
will come and help him look for his dead child.</p>

<p>They find Lily-of-the-Forest on the evening of the
same day.</p>

<p>Down a lonely forest-glen, in a dark and tangled
thicket of young pines and larches, through which no
snowflake can make its way and upon which the loads of
snow lie heaped and arched till the young branches groan
again, in this thicket Forest-Lily is found sitting on the
ground, on the dry pine-needles, amid a family of six
roe-deer.</p>

<p>It is a very wonderful story. The child, returning
home, lost her way in the forest-glen; and, as she was no
longer able to cope with the masses of snow, she crept into
the dry thicket to rest. She did not long remain alone.
Hardly had her eyes begun to close, when a herd of deer,
old and young together, came up to her and sniffed at the
little girl and looked at her with gentle eyes of pity and
understanding, and were not the least afraid of this
human thing, but stayed and lay down and gnawed the
little trees and licked one another and were quite tame:
the thicket was their winter home.</p>

<p>The next day everything was muffled up in snow.
Forest-Lily sat in the dark, which was only tempered
by a faint twilight, and refreshed herself with the milk
which she was taking to her people, and nestled up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
against the kind animals so as not to become quite
numb with cold.</p>

<p>Thus passed the grim hours while she was lost. And,
when Lily-of-the-Forest had already laid her down to die
and, with her simple fancy, asked the animals to stay
with her faithfully in her last dying hour, suddenly the
roe-deer began to snuffle very strangely, and lifted their
heads, and pricked up their ears, and broke through the
thicket with wild bounds, and darted away with shrill
cries.</p>

<p>And now the men work their way through the snow
and underwood and see the little maiden and hurrah for
joy; and old Rüpel, who is among them, shouts:</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you to come and look in here with me,&mdash;that
perhaps she was with the deer?"</p>

<p>And so it was; and when Berthold heard that the
beasts of the forest had saved his child from being frozen
to death, he yelled like a madman:</p>

<p>"Never again! As long as I live, never again!"</p>

<p>And he took the rifle with which for many years he had
killed the beasts of the forest and smashed it on a stone.</p>

<p>I saw it myself; for I and the parish priest were in the
Karwässer to help look for Lily-of-the-Forest.</p>

<p>This Lily-of-the-Forest is almost as soft and white as
snow and has the eyes of a roe-deer in her little head.</p>

The Sacred Cornfield</h2>

<p class="ma-bot2">(<i>The translation of a chapter from "Jakob der Letzte," in which tragic
story Rosegger tells how a rich man comes to a poor upland community,
and gradually bribes and tricks all the peasants except Jacob&mdash;who after a
dignified and then desperate effort to save the place, breaks his heart and
goes mad&mdash;to part with their homes and holdings to him for deer-forest.</i>)</p>


<p class="cap3"><span class="upper">Again</span> and again Jacob sought refuge in his work.
It was a good thing for him that it was pressing,
and left little time for his heartache. The field must be
tilled, the garden manured, and the meadows watered.
In the early part of the year the melted snow rushes
wildly down, often tearing up the earth as it goes; then
comes the hot sunshine on the slopes: so that to-day
there is too much moisture and to-morrow too little.
Hardly had the first blades sprouted when the cattle were
driven to the higher pastures, for the winter's supply of
fodder was nearly all devoured before the spring gave its
new green. Living through the winter on moss and
brushwood, the beasts were in such poor condition when
at last they came out into the open that they could hardly
climb the slopes, and many a one would slip and break
a leg.</p>

<p>And yet there was a new motto in Altenmoos: up
with cattle-breeding and down with agriculture! Jacob
could not make up his mind to alter his method of farming:
he loved his fields, all his heart was in them, and their
tending was a ritual to him.</p>

<p>When, as sower, he trod the long furrows, casting the
seed abroad in the earth, it was in an earnest, almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
solemn manner, as if he were about some sacred business;
and then before his eyes the miracle of the divine love
began to fulfil itself. This man, with all his anxiety, his
hope, his silent grief, knew nothing better than to watch
the resurrection of the buried grain. In the peaceful time,
after his working day was over and he sat alone, utterly
alone on his stone-heap, he would give himself up to
blessed contemplation. Before him the brown fields
stretch away, the larks blow trumpets, and in tender,
reddish blades the dead arise and look up to heaven.
Then gradually everything begins to grow green, the tiny
leaves curl and bend earthwards again as if they are
listening for any good counsels about life that the Mother
may have to give them. Then they aspire upwards,
rolling themselves into sheaths, out of which, little by
little, emerges the stalk and the inmost being of the corn.
By the time Ascension Day is there the corn is looking
skywards even in the mountain districts, as if gazing in
loving gratitude after Him who called it to life, and who
will come again to waken the human seeds that are sown
in all the churchyards. In the young summer breeze
the cornfield ripples like a blue-green lake, with the
cloud-shadows gliding graciously over it. And the single
blade is now in its full glory. The four-sided ear, in which
the still tender grains lie scale-like over each other,
hangs its blossom out like tiny flags wherever a grainlet
lies in its cradle, which flutter and tremble without
ceasing, while the high stalk rocks thoughtfully to and fro.</p>

<p>God keep us from storms in this blessed season!
From rain, too, with the sun shining through it, for that
breeds mildew. Wet seasons cause a growth upon the
ears, for which the local name of Mother-grain is far too
pretty for truth. The sky-climbing youth of the corn
soon comes to an end, the hot summer whitens its hair;
then, still conscious of its strength and its virtue, it yet
bows its head in humility before Him who has given it
virtue and strength.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>Deeper within this forest of grain, thistles and the
parasitical couch grass, the fair-seeming darnel, and
every sort of tangled rubble and lawless company thrive
rankly enough in the shadow of the corn and are nourished
upon its roots. There, also, the wanton corn-cockle is
to be found, whose seed later makes the flour&mdash;if not
already red with shame&mdash;such a dirty bluish colour;
there the will-o'-the-wisp poppy, and the kindly, patriarchal
cornflower, whose crown is made of many little
crowns.</p>

<p>Many a time, while a thunderstorm was raging over
Altenmoos, Jacob would stand under the heavy eaves
over his door, looking out quiet and resigned. Man
cannot alter things, God is almighty; what is the good,
then, of trembling or complaining? When it grows light,
he sees his whole cornfield, now nearly ripe, beaten
down. Jacob says, "Thanks and praise be to God that
there was no ice in it&mdash;all the stalks lie in order and flat
on the ground, not one lifts so much as a knee! The heavy
rain has laid the corn low, the wind will dry it&mdash;lift it
up again." But there are years when it does not get up,
when the rain beats it down again and again; then it is
that the alien, lawless rabble get the upper hand&mdash;they
rise up from between the prone stalks, and weave a trellis
overhead, and begin a godless blooming and bragging
above the poor imprisoned corn.</p>

<p>When, however, God does give rain and sunshine in
due season (just as the folks who go pilgrimages pray to
have it), the fields are glorious. Strong and slender the
stalks grow up from joint to joint. The lance-shaped,
dark green leaves that lorded it at first, have nearly
vanished, the stalks droop their heavy heads, which
give back the sown grain thirty or forty-fold, one stalk
laying its golden head on the shoulder of another. In the
sun's heat by day, at night in the light of the moon and
the stars and the glimmer of glow-worms, they are
ripening towards harvest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>At last come the reapers. Every grain is armed with
a sharp spear for defence or offence, but the reaper does
not flinch before the fine-toothed saws that allow no
hand to glide downwards, but only upwards from below,&mdash;only
from lowly to lofty.</p>

<p>When Jacob, always first and last in the heat and
burden of the day, rests in late evening beneath a corn-stook
in the harvest-field, his dreaming begins again.
The breath of grass and flowers makes him drowsy:
he watches the antics of a jolly grasshopper, hears the
chirp of a cricket&mdash;then it all fades away. He is looking
out over a country where there is no blue forest, no green
meadows, no mountain crags, and no clear streams.
So far as ever the eye can reach is one great golden sea,
an immeasurable field of corn. Above it, a cloudless sky
presses hot and heavy on his heart. Then it comes to
his mind: "Say thy grace, Jacob, for this place is the
table of a mighty people. Those who live in the mountains
must tend their poultry and their cattle, and fetch the
bread of corn from this table."</p>

<p>Then Jacob awakes, pulls himself up by the stook, and
says into the night, "It'll have to come to that. And
yet the cornfield is beautiful&mdash;more beautiful than anyhow
else&mdash;when it lies between the forest and meadow!
And a home, if it's a real home, should yield its children
everything that they need."</p>

<p>Besides, the soil in Altenmoos is not less rich than
elsewhere! When the last wagon-load of sheaves has
gone swaying home to the barn, there's always something
for the poor woman who comes gleaning the scattered
ears among the stubble. Then the cattle are pastured
there, and a fine grass springs up; only the beasts must
not mind a stubble-prick in the nose for every mouthful
they get. At last, it may be, the plough comes again,
still unwilling as ever to grant the fields a rest; but then
comes Winter, and says, "Enough!" and covers the
tired earth with its white mantle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>Even under that cover there is no peace. A little
grain fell out of the sheaf at harvest-time; the earth
takes it to herself, lets it silently decay, and gives it back
again, all new-made, in the sunshine of the following
spring.</p>

<p>With such dreams, whereby, as on Jacob's ladder, he
climbed up and down between earth and heaven, this
lonely man pleased and edified himself; and when the
shadow came over his spirit, he would say to himself,
"In God's name, Jacob, if it must be, thou mayst
well entrust thyself willingly to the faithful and undying
earth. Perhaps thou wilt rise up again, and find better
days in Altenmoos."</p>

About my Mother</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<p class="cap2"><span class="upper">It</span> was high carnival in Gratz city. In the evenings,
a mad thronging in the streets, a well-nigh deafening
rattling of carriages, a yelling and shouting, a flaring
and glaring from the shops and stalls and from the
hundreds of lamps and numberless transparencies in the
windows. Gold and silver, silks and damasks gleamed in
the shop-fronts. Masks of every hue and shape grinned
beside them. Ha, what a mad thing life can be!</p>

<p>I hurried through the crowd. The clock on the castle
hill struck six: six strokes so clear that they outrang all
the din and re-echoed from the tall, light-pierced walls of
the houses. The summons of the clock is a stern admonisher:
let man play as childishly as he will with
tinsel pleasures and light dalliance, it counts the hours
out to him and gives him not a minute's grace.</p>

<p>I went home to my quiet room and was soon in bed.</p>

<p>Next morning, the winter sun lay shining on the snow-clad
roofs; and I was jotting down the fairy-tale of the
Lost Child, when someone knocked at my door. A man
entered and handed me a telegram:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="ma-top1 ma-bot1">"Dear son, yesterday evening, at six o'clock, our dear
mother passed away. Come home, we are expecting you
in the greatest affliction. Your father."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Last evening it had happened, in the poor cottage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
while I was striding through the worldly turmoil. And
at six o'clock!</p>

<p>Early next morning, I was in the parish village. I
entered on the road alone, over hills glittering with snow
and through long woods, far into the lonely mountain
valley. I had walked that road endless times before,
had always delighted in the glistening snow, in the sparkling
icicles, in the snowy mantles of the boughs, or, if
it was summer, in the green leaves and the blossoms and
the fragrance, in the song of the birds, in the drops of light
that trickled through the branches, in the profound
peace and loneliness. How often had I gone that way
with mother, when she was still well and in her prime,
and, later, when, crippled through illness, she tottered
along on my arm! And, on this forest road, I thought of
my parents' life.</p>

<p>He had come to the forest farm a young man.</p>

<p>People called him Lenz, not because he was young
and blooming and joyful as the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Lenz</i>, or spring, but
because his name was Lorenz.</p>

<p>His father had been severely wounded in a brawl, lain
ill for but a little while and died an early death.</p>

<p>So now Lenz was the owner of the forest farm. To
recover in a measure from his sadness for his father's
sake, he did a capital thing: he looked about him
for a wife. He took almost the poorest and the most
disregarded that the forest valley contained: a girl
who was frightfully black all through the week, but had
quite a nice little white face on Sundays. She was the
daughter of a charcoal-burning woman and worked for
her aged mother, but had never seen her father.</p>

<p>One year after the wedding, in the summer, the young
woodman's wife presented her Lenz with a first-born.
He received the name of Peter and now runs all over the
world with it, an everlasting child.</p>

<p>Her life was so peculiar, her life was so good, her life
had a crown of thorns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>Our farm was no small one and its days were well-ordered;
but my mother did not play the grand farmer's
wife: she was housewife and servant-maid in one.</p>

<p>My mother was an educated woman: she could
"read print"; she had learnt that from a charcoal-burner.
She knew the story of the Bible by heart; and she had
no end of legends, fairy-tales and songs from her mother.
Moreover, she was always ready with help in word and
deed and never lost her head in any mishap and always
knew the right thing to do.</p>

<p>"That's how my mother used to do, that's what my
mother used to say," she was constantly remarking;
and this continued her rule and precept, long after her
mother was laid to rest in the churchyard.</p>

<p>No doubt, there was at times a little bigotry, what we
call "charcoal-burner's faith," mixed up with it, yet in
such a way that it did no harm, but rather spread a gentle
poetry over the poor life in the houses in the wood.</p>

<p>The poor knew my mother from far and wide: none
knocked at her door in vain; none was sent hungry away.
To him whom she considered really poor and who asked
her for a piece of bread she gave half a loaf; and, if he
begged for a gill of flour, she handed him a lump of lard
with it. And "God bless you!" she said, in addition:
that she always said.</p>

<p>"What will be the end of us, if you give everything away
wholesale?" my father often said to her, almost angrily.</p>

<p>"Heaven, perhaps," she answered. "My mother
often used to say that the angels register every 'God
reward you' of the poor before God's holy throne. How
glad we shall be one day, when we have the poor to intercede
for us with Our Lord!"</p>

<p>My father believed in fasting on Saturdays and often did
not take a morsel of food before the shadows began to
lengthen. He did this in honour of the Blessed Virgin.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20" href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>"I tell you, Lenz, that sort of fasting serves no useful
purpose!" my mother would sometimes say, in protest.
"What you go without to-day, you simply eat to-morrow.
My mother always used to say, 'What you have through
fasting left, give to the poor so sore bereft.' I somehow
think it does no good otherwise."</p>

<p>My father used to pray in the evenings, especially at
"rosary-time," and on Saturdays prayed long and loud,
but often did odd jobs at the same time, such as nailing
his shoes, patching his trousers or even shaving himself.
In so doing, he not seldom lost the thread of his prayers,
until my mother would snatch the things from his hands
and cry:</p>

<p>"Heavens alive, what manner of praying is this!
Kneeling beside the table and saying three Our Fathers
with application is better than three rosaries during
which the evil one steals away your good thoughts while
you're playing about!"</p>

<p>At times of hard work, my mother was fond of a good
table:</p>

<p>"Who works with a will may eat with a will," she
said. "My mother used always to say, 'Who dares
not risk to lose a tittle, dares not either win a little.'"</p>

<p>My father was content with scanty fare; he was always
fearing that the home would be ruined.</p>

<p>These were the only differences in their married life;
and even those did not go deep. They uttered them
only to each other: when father talked to strangers,
he praised mother; when mother talked to strangers,
she praised father.</p>

<p>They were of one mind as regarded the bringing-up
of children. Work and prayer, thrift and honesty, were
our main precepts.</p>

<p>I only once received a proper thrashing. In front of
the house was a young copse of larch&mdash;and fir-trees, which
gradually grew up so high that it shut out the view of the
mountains on that side. Now I loved this view and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
thought that father would be sure to thank me if I&mdash;who
was an enterprising lad in those days&mdash;cut down the
little trees. And, true enough, one afternoon, when everyone
was in the fields, I stole into the little wood with an
axe and began to cut down young trees. Before long,
my father appeared upon the scene; but the thanks
which he gave me had a very queer look.</p>

<p>"Lend me the hatchet, boy!" he said, quietly.</p>

<p>I thought, "Now he'll tackle to himself: so much the
better"; and I passed him the axe.</p>

<p>He used it to chop off a birch-switch and flattened it
across my back.</p>

<p>"Wait a bit!" he cried. "Do you want to do for
the young wood? It has more rods for you, where this
came from!"</p>

<p>I had a thrashing just once from my mother too.
I liked sitting by the hearth when mother was cooking;
and, one day, I knocked over the stock-pot full of soup,
half putting out the fire and nearly burning my little
bare feet. My mother was not there at the moment;
and, when she came running in at the sound of the mighty
hissing, I cried out, crimson in the face:</p>

<p>"The cat, the cat has upset the stock-pot!"</p>

<p>"Yes, that same cat has two legs and tells lies!"
mother retorted.</p>

<p>And she took me and thrashed me for a long time with
the rod.</p>

<p>"If ever you tell me a lie again," she cried, when she
had done, "I'll cut you to pieces with the flue-rake!"</p>

<p>A serious threat! Thank goodness, it never had to be
fulfilled.</p>

<p>On the other hand, when I was good and obedient,
I was rewarded. My reward took the form of songs
which she sang to me, tales which she told me, when we
walked through the forest together or when she sat by
my bedside in the evening. All that is best in me I have
from her. She had a worldful of poetry within her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>When my brothers and sisters came one after the other,
mother loved us all alike and favoured none. Afterwards,
when two died in their childhood, I saw mother for the
first time crying. We others cried with her and thenceforth
always cried whenever we saw mother shedding
tears.</p>

<p>And this was quite often, from that time onwards.
Father lay sick for two years on end. We had ill-luck
in the farm and in the fields; hail and murrain
came; our corn-mill was burnt down.</p>

<p>Then mother wept in secret, lest we children should
see her. And she worked without ceasing, fretted, and
ended by falling ill. The doctors of the whole neighbourhood
around were called in to advise: they could do
nothing but charge fat fees; only one of them said:</p>

<p>"I won't take payment from such poor people."</p>

<p>Yes, in spite of all our jollity, we had become poor
people. The goods and chattels were all gone; of the
once big property nothing remained to us but the taxes.
My father now resolved to sell the encumbered farm
as well as he could. But mother would not have it:
she worked on, ill as she was, with trouble and zeal, and
never gave up hope. She could not bear to think of
giving up her home, the house where her children were
born. She denied her illness, said that she had never felt
better in her life and that she would work for three.</p>

<p>My brothers and sisters also considered that they
could not leave the homestead; besides, none of them
had one good pair of shoes left to put on. And mother,
when, once in a way, she wished to go to the parish
church, had to borrow a jacket free from patches from
some journeyman-woodman's wife or other. And the
greatest pain of all was people's arrogance and their scorn
if ever they did lend any assistance. They had forgotten
the kindnesses which my mother had once shown to one
and all according to her power. At that time, she was
the most honoured farmer's wife in all the houses in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
forest. But&mdash;misfortune destroys friendship! As, indeed,
her mother, the charcoal-burner, had often said.</p>

<p>I will relate an experience of that sad time, when my
mother was ailing. It begins with a bright and sunny
Whitsuntide.</p>

<p>That bright and sunny Whit Monday was her thirty-ninth
birthday. It was a gladsome day. The crops were
green in the fields; and the herds grazed in the high
meadow: true, they did not belong to us, but to our
neighbour; and yet we delighted in them, because they
were fat and jolly. My father had already paid last
year's taxes; the financial position, which had been
disturbed during father's long illness, seemed gradually
coming to rights; and consequently we were once more
rising in people's opinions. On this day, we walked
through the meadows together; and the little ones picked
flowers and the grown-ups praised God's works with a
cheerful word or a song. Then mother sat down on a
stone and was like to die.</p>

<p>We dragged her home, we put her to bed, where she
lay for long: weeks long, months long. All the neighbours
came and brought their well-meant sympathy; all the
doctors from near and far came and brought their well-meant
medicine. The patient, as they admitted behind
her back, had had a stroke; she was languishing. But,
when the cool autumn came, she grew better: she now
no longer lay in bed by day, but sat on the bench by the
fire or at the table, where the children played, or by the
hearth, where she instructed clumsy father in the art of
cooking. She was not cheerful, nor was she cast down;
she took things as they came and did not complain:
only, between whiles, when she was alone, she heaved a
deep sigh. Thus winter passed. The delightful Whitsuntide
came again and mother was ill.</p>

<p>At this festival, the old woman from the Riegelberg
came to see us and brought a few rolls with her. She
suggested all sorts of household remedies and reckoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
up a number of hale and hearty people who had become
hale and hearty through taking the aforesaid remedies.
And at last she asked, hadn't we been to Stegthomerl&mdash;Tom
of the Footpath&mdash;yet?</p>

<p>No, we confessed, we had not been to him as yet.</p>

<p>Then how could we have been so remiss and however
could we have neglected to go to Tom of the Footpath?
He was the very first to whom one ought to send in that
sort of illness!</p>

<p>But it was such a distance to get there, father objected.
"And, if it was a three days' journey, it is not too
far for health's sake."</p>

<p>"That's very true, I grant you: it would not be too
far for health," said father. "And think you, Riegelbergerin,
that he could cure her?"</p>

<p>"Curing, my dear woodman, is in God's hands,"
answered the woman from the Riegelberg, with her
wonted superiority. "Even the best doctors cannot
work miracles. But he knows, does Tom of the Footpath,
and he'll tell you whether a cure is still possible or not."
The very next day, a messenger was sent over the
mountains to the valley where Tom of the Footpath
lived. He went off early and he came home late and he
brought the answer that Tom of the Footpath had said
he could say nothing at all as long as he did not see the
invalid for himself.</p>

<p>The next day, another messenger went off (for the first
had gone lame on the long road) to fetch Tom of the Footpath.
He came back late at night alone and brought the
news that Tom of the Footpath didn't visit patients:
Thomas himself was not as young as he had been; also he
did not wish to be locked up again because the qualified
doctors suffered from an infernal professional jealousy
and wanted to bury everybody themselves. If the sick
woodman's wife cared to come to him, there might be
something to be done. But he did not go running after
sick people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>This was manfully spoken, after all, and we all of us
understood that a man who knows his own value does
not exactly care to make himself cheap. But now came
a great embarrassment. The weather, to be sure, was
fine and warm; the days were long, and mother was
quite ready to go. But how were we to carry her on that
many-hours' road to Tom of the Footpath? It was
impossible. Drive? We had no cart; and the last pair
of draught-oxen had been taken from us by the creditors
to whom we had had to apply once more during mother's
illness. The neighbours were using their oxen just now
for ploughing the fields. The jobbing farmer had two
horses: he was willing to let them out to us, but his
charge for the day&mdash;father struck his hands together at
the thought&mdash;was five florins and their oats.</p>

<p>And, as we were all sitting in deep distress around our
sick mother, seeking for a way out of the difficulty and
finding none, the door opened and the lad from the road-side
tavern walked in.</p>

<p>"What do you want, my boy?" asked my father.</p>

<p>The boy stood dangling his arms.</p>

<p>"Ay," he said, "it's this way: Samersteffel sends
word to say that, if the woodman likes to have his horse
and cart, he can have them."</p>

<p>Samersteffel was what Stephen, the local carrier, was
called.</p>

<p>"Where is Carrier Steve?"</p>

<p>"He's with us and he's put up his horse and cart at
our place."</p>

<p>My father thought over what he had better say; then
he said:</p>

<p>"Steve is sure to want a good price; tell him from
me, no, but I'm obliged to him."</p>

<p>The boy went away; and, in an hour's time, Carrier
Steve came round in person. He was a little fat man,
who, in the old days, before the road was made, used to
carry all sorts of things over the mountain-path with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
pack-horse. Now that the road was there, he had set up
a little light cart, in which he conveyed corn, salt, cider
and so on, but all for money, of course, as that was what
he lived by; and not only that, but he wanted to get
rich, so as to build a big inn on the new road. To be an
innkeeper was the dream of his life; and he had the
making of one in him, for he was always in a good temper
and would certainly know how to entertain his visitors.</p>

<p>But to-day, when he walked into our parlour, he was
in anything but a good temper.</p>

<p>"You're making a lot of useless trouble for one of us,"
he said, and sat down puffing and panting on the bench
against the wall. "Have you ever heard, woodman, that
I have pressed myself on anyone for the sake of gain?
You can't have heard such a thing said about me, for,
thank God, I don't need it. Once I myself propose to
carry anything, I carry it gratis. I heard that your
wife wanted to go to Tom of the Footpath and that she
had no trap of any kind. My mother, God rest her soul,
was also ill for a long time; I know what it means: it's a
misery. If you like, woodman, I'll drive your wife over
to Tom of the Footpath to-morrow."</p>

<p>Then we all felt really glad. We did not give a further
thought to the question whether the long drive would do
good or harm, or whether the new physic would take
effect, or how the illness would turn out afterwards. To
Tom of the Footpath, just to Tom of the Footpath:
that would put everything right.</p>

<p>I was awakened early next day, when the morning
star peeped through the great black ash-trees. Father
had to stay behind to look after the farm; and I, the
thirteen-year-old lad, must go with mother to see that
nothing happened to her. Mother was already at her
breakfast and did as if she thoroughly relished the milk-porridge.
Carrier Steve and I ate a bowl of curds and
whey and then we drove off. Steve sat on the little
driver's seat and talked out loud to his nag, telling it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
be a good horse and trot over the mountains briskly
"so that we can bring woodman's wife home again before
the day is out." My mother sat, wrapped up in all her
clothes, and my father's storm-cloak into the bargain, on
a leather cushion, with straw at her feet and a heavy
blanket over all, allowing only a part of her head to show
above it. I sat beside this sick-bed and was heavy at
heart.</p>

<p>It was still chilly night; the sky began to turn a little
pale over the Wechselberg. The road led across the
meadows. Now the birds woke; now the glory of the
dawn commenced; now the great sun rose in the heavens.
My mother drew back the blanket a little and gazed up
at the sun:</p>

<p>"I feel full of hope," she whispered and felt for my
hand, "if only the summer helps a bit and Tom of the
Footpath too. After all, I'm not so old yet. What do
you think, my child? Shall I be able to look at the world
again a hale woman?"</p>

<p>I was as confident as she; I felt quite relieved. The
morning sun! The dear warm morning sun!</p>

<p>Mother became chatty.</p>

<p>"It's silly, when you come to think of it," she said,
suddenly, and laughed almost aloud, "how fond a body
is of being in the world. Of course, I should be sorry to
leave my folk. And it would be a pity for my Lenzel,
your father, to be left all alone; the children are so
small yet."</p>

<p>"But I'm getting pretty big now," I protested.</p>

<p>Then mother turned her face right round to me and
said:</p>

<p>"It's just you, my Peter, it's just you about whom I'm
most anxious. You see, you appear to me quite different
from other boys of your age. You've no real mind for
work, that is to say, you have the mind, perhaps, but you
take no honest pleasure in it. Yes, yes, deny it as you
may, I know you, you don't care about farming, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
hang around and you want something else, you yourself
don't know what. You see, that's really the worst of it.
And so I should like to pray to God and ask Him to leave
me with you, so that I can keep a hold on you until I
know what's to become of you."</p>

<p>"Will you be a carrier? How would that suit you,
boy?" cried Steve, over his shoulder, to us in the cart.</p>

<p>"A good carrier, who takes poor people driving: I
wouldn't mind that," remarked my mother, whereupon
Steve gave a little smirk.</p>

<p>The road led straight up and became stony; Steve and
I got down and walked beside the creaking cart. The
sun had become hot. It was a tiring drive and we only
got on slowly.</p>

<p>When we were up at the top and driving along through
the almost level, but dark woods of the Fischbacheralpe,
we no longer heard the cart-wheels, for the ground was
thickly strewn with pine-needles, save that, every now
and again, the wheels struck against a root. The birds
had become silent, for the hot day lay over the tree-tops.
My mother had fallen asleep. I looked at her pale face
and thought:</p>

<p>"Tom of the Footpath is sure to know of something
that will do her good; it's a lucky thing that we were
able to drive to Tom of the Footpath."</p>

<p>"Like a bit of bread, Peter?" asked Steve.</p>

<p>"I should be glad of a bit."</p>

<p>And, when I got my piece of bread, there was a piece
of bacon on it; and now my distress began. I held the
thing in my hand for ever so long and looked at it and
looked up at my mother: she was asleep. I did not want
to offend Steve, who meant so well by us. As, however, I
could not leave the thing as it was, lying in my hand, I at
last began, first quite softly, but gradually louder, to call
out:</p>

<p>"Steve!"</p>

<p>"What do you want?" he asked, at last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>"I should only like to beg as a favour," I said, quite
despondently, "just as a favour, that I need not eat the
bacon. For indeed I don't like bacon."</p>

<p>"You don't know what's good," said the driver,
laughing, and relieved me of my difficulty.</p>

<p>At last, we began to go downhill; and now the cart
jolted over the burning stones and shook the invalid out
of her sleep; and the sun burnt into her marrow; and
she felt chilled all the same.</p>

<p>Steve muttered:</p>

<p>"Tom of the Footpath must be the devil of a good
doctor to make a drive like this worth while. Hold up,
Sorrel: we've not much further to go."</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when we reached the valley
and stopped at the little house where Tom of the Footpath
lived.</p>

<p>We carried mother into the musty, stuffy parlour, in
which all the little windows were tight shut. There we
let her down on the bench and asked for Tom.</p>

<p>A grumpy old woman answered that Tom was not there.</p>

<p>"We can see that," said Steve, "but might we ask
where he is?"</p>

<p>"Can't say."</p>

<p>"When's he coming in?"</p>

<p>"Maybe he won't stay out long, maybe he won't be
back till night, maybe he's gone to the ale-house."</p>

<p>The old woman left the room; and there we sat. My
mother drew a deep breath.</p>

<p>Steve went after the old woman and asked her for a
spoonful of hot soup for the invalid.</p>

<p>"Where should I get hot soup from at this time of
day? The fire's been out on the hearth this long since."</p>

<p>That was the answer. Thereupon the driver himself
set to and lit the fire, looked for milk and boiled it.</p>

<p>Mother ate only a little of the soup and pushed the bowl
to us, so that we should have some warm food too.</p>

<p>When that was done, Steve gave the woman a silver ten-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>kreuzer
for the milk and for the hay which the sorrel
ate.</p>

<p>After a time, during which it turned quite dark in the
parlour, once or twice, because clouds were passing in
front of the sun outside, Tom of the Footpath walked
into the room. He was a short, spindle-shanked man, but
had a big head, broad shoulders, a very high chest and a
great hump on his back. And his head was sunk into his
shoulders, so that the mannikin had to turn right round,
with his whole body, whenever he wanted to turn his
head. I can see him plainly to this day, as he stepped
in through the door and looked at us, first sharply and
then smilingly, with his wandering, vacant face.</p>

<p>My mother at once became fidgety and tried to rise
from her seat, in order to put her request to him in a
respectful fashion.</p>

<p>Tom made a sign with his hand that she need not
trouble and presently said, in a rather sing-song voice:</p>

<p>"I know, I know, you're the woodman's wife from
the Alpel; you had a stroke a year ago."</p>

<p>"I had a stroke?" asked the invalid, in dismay.</p>

<p>"You've been doctoring all round the place, far and
wide; and now, because no one else can do you any good,
you come to me. They're all alike: they come to me when
they're dying; and if, after that, Tom of the Footpath's
physic doesn't work a miracle and the patient goes the
way of all flesh, then they say that Tom of the Footpath
has been the cause of his death."</p>

<p>These words were terrible to listen to, in themselves,
but still they were bearable because they were spoken
with a smiling face and because Tom went on to add:</p>

<p>"Hope it'll prove an exception in your case, woodman's
wife. I'll just examine you now."</p>

<p>First of all, of course, he felt her pulse:</p>

<p>"It hops," he muttered, "it hops."</p>

<p>Then, with his broad fingers, he pushed her eyebrows
apart and looked into the whites&mdash;and said nothing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
Next, she had to bare her neck and he put his ear to it&mdash;and
said nothing. Furthermore, he attentively studied
the lines of her hand, then asked after the sick woman's
actual state of health and went on to examine the arteries
and the respiration, so that I at once conceived a high
opinion of the man's conscientiousness.</p>

<p>And, when he had finished his examination, he sat
down on a chair opposite my mother, who was slowly
wrapping herself up again in her clothes, spread out his
legs, sank his chin into his body and, with his arms crossed
over his chest, said:</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear woodman's wife, you've got to die."</p>

<p>My mother gave a light start, I sprang to my feet.
Steve, however, remained sitting quite calmly in his seat,
looked hard at Tom of the Footpath for a while and then
said, suddenly:</p>

<p>"And you haven't, I suppose? No, you old camel,
your day's coming too, God damn it all!"</p>

<p>It was now high time to go. We hurriedly packed up
and drove off homeward.</p>

<p>It was sultry and shady; the sky was covered with
clouds; there was not a living thing in sight; not a tree-top
stirred; our cart rattled heavily along. My mother
lay silently in her corner and gazed at the darkling world
with her great, black eyes.</p>

<p>Steve sat fuming on his box, but gradually became
quieter; and he now grunted:</p>

<p>"To think of a man being as drunk as all that!"</p>

<p>"Who?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Such a drunken bout is really worth making a day's
journey to go and have a look at," Steve continued.
"True enough, I'd heard tell that the old camel was
seldom sober; and he'd come straight from the ale-house
to-day."</p>

<p>"I dare say it was just as well," my mother said.
"If he had been sober, perhaps he would not have told
me the truth."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>And so we drove away in great sadness. The thunder
rolled over the mountains, quite hoarse and dull; the
Fischbach storm-bell rang in the distance. Then my
mother sat upright and said:</p>

<p>"You must do something to please me, Peter; and
I'll ask Steve as well: it's no use telling father, my
husband, what Tom of the Footpath said."</p>

<p>"Indeed, it would never do to repeat such fool's talk,"
cried the driver, very loudly, "but I'm going to the
magistrate! I shall inform against him! That's what
I shall do!"</p>

<p>"I beg of you, Steve, let it be," my mother asked. "You
mustn't think that I take it so much to heart. I myself
have often thought that the thing will end with me as it
ends with all ailing people. What can Tom of the Footpath
do against that! We did not go to him to get him to
tell us lies. I'm only sorry that we never once asked
what we owed him for his straightforwardness."</p>

<p>Now Steve burst out laughing and sent the whip
whizzing once or twice through the air, notwithstanding
that the horse was doing its best.</p>

<p>When we drove along over the heights, the threatening
storm had dispersed entirely; the setting sun shone with
a faint golden gleam over the wide landscape, over wood
and meadows; and a cool breeze blew in our faces.</p>

<p>A bright tear lay on my mother's pale cheeks.</p>

<p>As, silent and tired, we drove through our home
meadows, the stars appeared in the sky. On every side,
the song of the crickets purled and chirped in the grass.
By the fence, where our hillside began, stood a black
figure that accosted us and asked if it was we.</p>

<p>It was my father, who had come to meet us. My
mother called him by name; her voice was weak and
trembling.</p>

<p>Father took us indoors, without asking a question.</p>

<p>Not until we were in the parlour and the rushlight
was burning did he ask how we had fared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>"Not badly," said Steve, "not at all badly: we have
been very cheerful."</p>

<p>"And Tom of the Footpath: what did he say?"</p>

<p>"He said that, like other people, woodman's wife
wouldn't live for ever, but that she has plenty of time
before her, oh, plenty of time. Only you're to take care:
give her lots of good air in the summer, not too much
work and no excitement, good food and drink and no
physic, no physic at all, he said. And then she'll get all
right again."</p>

<p>A time elapsed after that. My father tried to nurse
mother according to Steve's dictum, which he believed
to be Tom of the Footpath's dictum; and, when winter
came, she sat at the spinning-wheel and span. The mouse
had not bitten the thread in two.</p>

<p>That same winter brought the news that Tom of the
Footpath had been found frozen to death in the snow,
not far from the ale-house on the Fischbacheralpe. We
said an Our Father for his soul.</p>

<p>Carrier Steve, who came to see us now and then and
always remained the good, cheerful man he was, had also
forgiven Thomas: true, it was wholly and solely because
he had proved wrong that time.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>I failed&mdash;to return to our other circumstances&mdash;to
take any pleasure in the peasant's life and also I
really lacked the strength for it. I then took up a trade,
but was not able to help my parents; I wanted to pay
my father for my Sunday board, which I had at home,
but he would take nothing from me, said that I was just
as much his child as before, only I must not burn so many
rushes when I was home on Saturday nights.</p>

<p>"Oh, goodness me, let him have that pleasure: he
hasn't so many!" my mother would say and intercede
for me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>Then things altered with me. I went into the world.
It was hard parting with my mother; but, in a short
time, she was able to see that my life had become happier.</p>

<p>And, now that happiness had come, envy soon came
hobbling along&mdash;or was it stupidity? A rumour passed
through the forest hills:</p>

<p>"So far, it's all right with Peter; but, as always
happens in town, he is sure to fall away from the Christian
faith."</p>

<p>And soon the talk grew:</p>

<p>"A nice story that! All of a sudden, he finds honest
work too hard for him and righteous fare not good enough,
goes to town and eats flesh-meat on Our Lady's day
and falls away from the faith."</p>

<p>My mother laughed at first, when she heard that,
for she knew her child. But then the thought came to
her: suppose it were true after all! Suppose her dear
child were forgetting God and going astray!</p>

<p>She knew no peace. She went and borrowed clothes
from blind Julia and borrowed three florins from a good-natured
huckstress and travelled&mdash;sick and infirm as she
was, leaning with either hand on a stick&mdash;to the capital.
She wanted to see for herself what was true in people's
talk. She found her child a poor student in a black coat,
which he had had given him, and with his hair combed
off his forehead. None of this pleased her greatly, it is
true; it succeeded, however, in appeasing her. But, in
the two days of her stay in town, she saw the mad,
frivolous doings on every side, saw the neglect of old
customs which she revered and the mocking of things that
were sacred to her, and she said to me:</p>

<p>"You will never be able to stay among people like
those, child; they would drag you down with them and
ruin your soul."</p>

<p>"No, mother," I answered, "a man can think as he
wishes; and people can't take away good thoughts."</p>

<p>She said no more. But, when she returned to the forest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
hills and heard the talk again, she was more dejected
than ever.</p>

<p>It was all up now with the homestead. House and
farm were sold, made over to the creditors; my brothers
and sisters engaged as servants with strange farmers.
The destitute parents were given a cottage that, until
then, had belonged to the property. My youngest brother,
who was not yet able to earn his bread, and one sister
remained with them and nursed poor mother. Father
kept on going over the mountains to the doctors', and
all but promised them his own life, if they could save the
life of his wife.</p>

<p>In the cottage, things looked very wretched. The ailing
woman suffered in silence. The light of her eyes threatened
to fail her, her mental faculties appeared to fade. Death
knocked at her heart with repeated strokes. She often
seemed to endure severe pain, but said nothing; she
no longer took any interest in the world, asked only
after her husband, after her children. And she lay years
a-dying.</p>

<p>I often came to see her during that time. She hardly
knew me, when I stood by her bedside; but then again
she would say, as in a dream:</p>

<p>"Is that you, Peterl? Praise and thanks be to God
that you are here again!"</p>

<p>During midsummer, we would carry her, once in a way,
with bed and all, out of the stuffy room into the air,
so that she might see the sunshine once more. I do not
know if she saw it: she kept her eyes open and looked
up at the sun; her optic nerves seemed dead.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, days came when she was different.
She was cheerful and longed to go out into the open.</p>

<p>"Do get quite well again, Maria," said her husband,
"and we shall remain together a long while yet."</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered.</p>

<p>I thought of all this on my way through the forest&mdash;and
now it was all over with this poor rich life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>When, at last, after walking for hours through the woods
along the mountain-path, I saw the thatched cottage
on the hill-side, then it was as though a misty shadow
covered woods and plains and all; and yet the sunlight
hung over it. A puff of grey smoke rose from the little
chimney. Does she suspect my coming? thought I.
Is she cooking my favourite dish? No, strangers are
preparing a funeral feast.</p>

<p>You stood long, Peterl, outside the half-open door;
and your hand trembled when at last it touched the latch.
The door opened, you walked in, it was dark in the narrow
passage, with only a dim little oil-lamp flickering in a
glass, and yet you saw it clearly: against the wall, under
the smoky stairs, on a plank lay the bier, covered entirely
with a big white cloth. At the head stood a crucifix
and the holy-water stoup, with a sprig of fir in it&hellip;.</p>

<p>You fell upon your knees&hellip;. And the tears came
at last. The tears which the mother's heart once gave us
to take with us into this world for our relief in sorrow
and for our only consolation in the hour when no other
comfort reaches the soul, when strangers cannot understand
us and when the mother's heart has ceased to beat.
Hail, O rich and eternal legacy!</p>

<p>Now the door of the parlour opened softly and Maria,
the younger sister, stepped out. The girl at once began
to cry when she saw the brother of whom they had all
spoken so often, for whom mother's last glance had
asked and who was far away when she closed her eyes.
Now he lay there on his knees and cried over the memory
of her life.</p>

<p>Even her children here at home had slept through the
night of the death. Not till the glow of early morning
lit up the little windows did father go to the girls in the
bedroom and say:</p>

<p>"Open your eyes and look out. The sun is already
rising over the Wechsel; and the Blessed Virgin is sitting
on the mountain-top, with the Child Jesus on her knee;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
and your mother is sitting on the stool at her feet, with
a spinning-wheel before her, weaving her heavenly
garment."</p>

<p>Then they knew at once that mother was dead.</p>

<p>"Would you like to look at her?" my sister now
asked.</p>

<p>And she went to the head of the bier and slowly raised
the shroud.</p>

<p>I saw my mother. Heaven's bliss still lay on the
stiff, stark visage. The load was gone from my heart,
relieved and comforted; I looked upon the dear features
as though I were contemplating a white flower. It was
no longer the poor, sick, weary woman that lay before
me: it was the face lit up with a ray from the youthful
days long past. She lay there slumbering and was strong
and well. She was young again and white and gentle;
she wore a little smile, as she often did when she looked
at the merry little fellow playing about with his toys at
her feet. The dark and glossy hair (she had no grey hairs
yet) was carefully braided and peeped out a little at the
temples from under the brown kerchief, the one which
she loved best to wear upon her head when she went to
church on holidays. She held her hands folded over
her breast, with the rosary and the wax candle between
them. She lay there just as though she had fallen asleep
in church on Whit Sunday, during the solemn High Mass;
and thus, even in death, she comforted her child. But
the rough hands clearly showed that the slumberer had
led a hard and toilful life.</p>

<p>And so you stood before this sacred image, nearly as
still and motionless as the sleeper.</p>

<p>At last, you whispered to your little sister, who stood
softly weeping by your side:</p>

<p>"Who closed her eyes?"</p>

<p>A sound of hammering came from the parlour. The
carpenter was knocking together the last dwelling-house.</p>

<p>After a while, Maria drew the shroud over the head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
again, as softly and carefully as when she used to cover
up our little mother, hundreds and hundreds of times, in
the long period of sickness.</p>

<p>Then I went into the small, warm parlour. Father,
my elder sister, my two brothers, of whom the younger
was still a boy, came up to me with mournful looks.
They hardly spoke a word, they gave me their hands,
all but the little fellow, who hid himself in the chimney-corner,
where we could hear his sobbing.</p>

<p>Joseph the carpenter was calmly planing away at the
coffin, which he had now finished joining, and smoked his
pipe as he did so.</p>

<p>Later, when the afternoon shadows had lengthened
outside, far over the glittering snow-clad meadow-land,
when, in the parlour, Joseph was painting the black cross
on the coffin-lid, father sat down beside it and said,
softly:</p>

<p>"Please God, after all, she has a house of her own
again."</p>

<p>On the first day after mother's death, no fire had been
lit on the cottage-hearth. One and all had forgotten
that a mortal man wants a basin of hot soup in the
morning and at mid-day. On the other hand, a blazing
fire had been kindled on the field behind the little house,
to burn the straw bedding on which she had died, even
as, long ago, the forefathers had fanned their Odin fires,
commending the beloved dead to the Goddess Hella, the
great concealer.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21" href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>I had sat down on the bench and lifted my little brother
up to me. The little man glanced at me quite fearsomely:
I had a black coat on and a white scarf round my neck
and I looked very grand in his eyes. I held his little
hand, which already had horny blisters on it, in mine.
Then I asked father to tell us something of mother's
life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>"Wait a little," answered father and looked on at the
drawing of the cross, as in a dream.</p>

<p>At last, he heaved a deep sigh and said:</p>

<p>"So it's finished now. Her cross and suffering lasted
long, that's true; but her life was short. Children,
I tell you, not everyone has a mother like yours. For
you, Peter, she nearly gave up her life, when you came
into the world. And so they followed one after the other:
joys and sorrows, care and want, poverty and wretchedness!
And, when I was sick unto death and the doctors
agreed that I must go the way of all flesh, that there
was no remedy for it, my wife never gave up hope, never
abandoned me. Day and night she stayed by my side,
forgetting to sleep, forgetting to eat a bit of bread. She
almost poured life back into me with her own breath&mdash;my
dear, good wife."</p>

<p>His voice seemed about to break; he wiped the moisture
from his eyes with his coat-sleeve.</p>

<p>"No one would believe what good nursing can do,"
he continued. "I became quite hale again. We lived on,
faithfully and fondly; and that you, Peter, found
success and happiness away from home, that was your
mother's greatest joy. You yourselves know how she
lay sick and dying for seven years and more, how they
turned us out of house and home, how spitefully people
talked and how, nevertheless, we had the greatest trust
in you children. For fully thirty years, we lived together
in wedlock. I always prayed that God might take <em>me</em>
first; now He has chosen rather to take <em>her</em>. You
mustn't cry like that, children: you were always a help
and a comfort to your mother."</p>

<p>He said no more.</p>

<p>When the carpentering of the coffin was done, father
put shavings inside it as a pillow. He had always had
the habit, when he had done his work, of going to his
wife and saying:</p>

<p>"I've finished now."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>And so, when he had put the shavings straight and made
the other preparations, he went out to the bier in the
passage and said:</p>

<p>"I've finished now."</p>

<p>Late in the evening, when the crescent moon stood in
the dark, clear sky and shed its twilight over the woods
and gleaming, snow-clad meadows and over the little
house in the forest on the hill-side, the snow creaked
continually on the roads and people came up from
farmsteads and distant cottages. Even though they had
carried on loud and cheerful conversations with one
another on the paths by which they had come, they
became silent now that they were nearing the cottage and
we heard only the crackling of their footsteps on the snow.</p>

<p>In the small front passage, which was dimly lit by the
little lamp, everyone knelt on the cold clay floor and
prayed silently before the bier and then sprinkled it with
holy water. After that, he went into the parlour to the
others, who sat round the table and the fireplace, singing
hymns and uttering pious reflections. They were all
there to accompany the poor woman of the house to her
last resting-place.</p>

<p>I would have kept on standing by the bier, if the people
had not been there, so that I might look at my mother.
I read my childhood and my youth in her features.
I thought that the bright eyes must open once more and
smile to me, that the word must once more come from
those lips which, in her loving-kindness, had been so
soft and tender. But, though I was her dear son and
however long I might stand beside her&mdash;she now slept
the eternal sleep.</p>

<p>I went into the low-ceilinged kitchen, where the neighbours'
wives were cooking the funeral meal; I looked
round in the smoke for my brothers and sisters, that I
might comfort them.</p>

<p>Inside, in the parlour, all were now as still as mice
and in great tension. Mathias, the old chamois-hunter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
who wore a brown shirt and a white beard, sat at the
table and told a story:</p>

<p>"There was once a farmer," he began, "who had a
wife, just a poor sick wife. And, one day, one holy
Easter morning, the wife died. The soul departed
from her body and stood there all alone in dark Eternity.
No angel was willing to come and lead her and show
her in to the heavenly Paradise. 'They are celebrating
Christ's resurrection in Heaven'&mdash;so the story ran&mdash;'and,
at such times, no saint or angel has time to show
a poor soul the way.' But the poor soul was in inexpressible
fear and terror, for she reflected that, because of
her illness, it was long since she had been to church. And
she already heard the devil whining and whimpering and
whistling and she thought that she was lost. 'O my holy
guardian angel and patron saint!' she cried. 'Come to
my help in this my need, or I must depart into hell-fire!'
But they were all in Heaven together, celebrating Our
Lord's resurrection. Thereupon the poor woman was
nigh to fainting away, without comfort or support;
but suddenly Our Lady stood by her side, draped in a
snow-white garment with a wreath of roses as a beautiful
ornament in her hand. 'Hail to thee and comfort, thou
poor woman!' she said, gently, to the departed soul.
'Thou hast been a pious sufferer all thy life long and
every Saturday thou hast fasted, for my sake, and what
thou hadst left over through the fasting thou hast given
to the poor, for my sake. This I will never forget to
thee; and, though my dear Son is commemorating His
glorious resurrection this day, yet will I think of thee
and carry thee to His golden throne and to thy joyful
place in the rose-garden by the angels, which I have
prepared for thy sake and where thou canst wait for
thy husband and thy children.' And then Our Lady
took the poor woman by the hand and carried her up
to Heaven. That is why I say that fasting and alms-giving
in honour of Our Lady are a right good work."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>So spake Mathias in his brown shirt.</p>

<p>"Our dear woodman's wife, whom we are burying
to-morrow, was also fond of fasting," said one little
woman, "and very fond of giving."</p>

<p>Father sobbed for emotion. The thought that his wife
was now in Heaven lit a very welcome light in his sad
heart.</p>

<p>The hands of the old soot-browned clock upon the wall&mdash;the
same which had faithfully told the hours, the joyful
hours and the sorrowful, since the woodman's glad
wedding-day; which pointed to the hour of one, early on
Sunday morning, when the little boy was born; which,
after many years, showed the hour of six, when the
delivering angel passed through the room and pressed
his kiss on the sufferer's forehead&mdash;the hands now met at
twelve o'clock.</p>

<p>And, when that departed life was thus measured, like
a single day, from sunrise to sunset, my father said:</p>

<p>"Boy, go outside to the cow-shed and lie down for a
while in the straw and rest a bit. I will wake you when
the time comes."</p>

<p>I went outside, took a last look at the bier in the passage
and then stepped out into the free, cold, starry night.
The sickle of the moon had sunk behind the woods;
it had sent its last beam gliding through the crevice of
the door on the shroud that covered the bier: to-morrow,
when it rose again, the poor creature would be lying in
the dark earth.</p>

<p>So now I lay in the shed on the straw, where my two
brothers generally slept. The three chained oxen stood
or lay beside me, grinding their teeth as they chewed
the cud. It was warm and damp in the stable; and the
moisture trickled from the half-rotten ceiling down on
my straw couch.</p>

<p>There was once a time&mdash;ay, the drops came quivering
down as now&mdash;the dew-drops from the trees, when mother
was taking you to make your first communion. I see you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
now, Peterl. You have a new jacket on, with a sprig of
rosemary in your hat. Your little snow-white shirt
shows round your neck above the waistcoat; and your
cheeks are rosy red with scrubbing. Mother is wearing a
bright-coloured dress, a brown apron and a black, tight-fitting
jacket. Her broad neckerchief is of red silk and
shines like fire and flame. A white-and-green spray of
flowers sticks out of her bosom. On her head, she wears
a high and costly golden cap, as was the fashion thenadays
throughout the country; and the curls peep out on either
side of the forehead, gleaming black like the two great
pupils of her eyes and soft and dainty like the lashes on
her lids. Her cheeks are tinged with the pink of the dawn;
her chin is white and daintily curved. Her red lips wear
a little smile and, at the same time, scold you, my little
man, because you are skipping so pertly over the stones
and roots and knocking the nails out of your shoes. No
child alive has ever seen his mother in the full flower of
her beauty; and yet how splendid it is, boy, even now!
All's aglow in the wood and alight in the young larches;
and the blooms are fragrant and the birds singing in
every tree-top.</p>

<p>Ah, child-time is May-time!</p>

<p>A dull, heavy knocking roused me from my dream;
I started up. Now they are laying my mother in the
coffin; now they are nailing down the lid.</p>

<p>I rushed out of the shed and into the house. There,
in the passage, stood the narrow, white, closed coffin;
and the dimly-flickering oil-lamp now lit up only the
empty, desolate plank on which the bier had stood.</p>

<p>I should have liked to see her once more&hellip;.</p>

<p>The people were preparing the litter. Father knelt
behind the door and prayed; the sisters wept in their
pinafores; and my little brother sobbed terribly. The
poor little fellow tried to keep in his tears, for he had
heard that all was for the best with mother and that she
was now enjoying peace in Heaven: he had smiled a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
little at that; but now, when the people were making
ready to carry mother away for good and all, there was
no comfort left in his sorely-afflicted little heart.</p>

<p>I took little brother by the hand and we went into
the furthermost dark corner of the room, where no one
else was and where only our sick mother had cared to sit.
There we sat down on the bench. And there we sat while
everything was being prepared outside, while the people
sat down to table and shared the funeral repast.</p>

<p>They had come to show us sympathy; now they were
eating, now they were laughing and then again they acted
as was customary; and they actually rejoiced that one
more person had died and, in so doing, brought variety
into their everyday lives.</p>

<p>Suddenly, loud words were heard outside:</p>

<p>"Where is the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Überthan</i>? We can't find the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Überthan</i>."</p>

<p>The <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Überthan</i> is a thin linen pall which is wrapped round
the coffin like a veil and, in the popular belief, serves
him or her who has risen from the dead as a garment
on the Day of Judgment.</p>

<p>Father was roused from his prayers by the shouting;
he now staggered around and looked for the linen sheet in
his press, on the shelves and in every nook and corner.
Why, he had brought it home only yesterday; and now
it was nowhere to be found! He had really lost his head:
he had to see that all got something to eat; he had to
change into his Sunday clothes to go to church; he had
to comfort his children; he had to fetch a new candle,
because the old one was burnt down to its socket and the
people were like to find themselves in the dark; he had
to go to the shed and give the cattle fodder enough to
last them all day, for there would be no one at home;
and now he was expected to say where he had put the
pall yesterday, in his confusion. And, in the next few
minutes, they would be carrying his wife out of the
house!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>It was one great excitement.</p>

<p>"So the old man has no pall!" they grumbled. "Such
a thing has never been known: carrying out a dead person
all naked and bare. But it must be true with the poor
woodman's wife: a pauper she lived and a pauper she
died!"</p>

<p>My two sisters began to hunt in their turn; and Maria
exclaimed, plaintively:</p>

<p>"Dear Jesus, my mother mustn't be buried without
a pall; she would do better than that to stay at home
here; and I will give my christening-money and buy her
her last dress. Who was it put away the linen sheet?
O God, they want to deny her the last thing of all, as
well as all the rest!"</p>

<p>I tried to calm the girl and said we should be sure to
get a linen sheet out in the village and, if not, then she
must rest in peace under the bare deal boards.</p>

<p>"How can you speak like that!" she cried. "Didn't
mother in her time buy your clothes for you out of her
hard-saved kreuzers? And now you want her to rise
on the Day of Judgment in her shabby clothes, when all
the others are wearing a white garment!"</p>

<p>She burst into loud crying and leant her glowing forehead
against the wall.</p>

<p>But, soon after, the people breathed again: they had
found the pall.</p>

<p>And, when they had eaten&mdash;we others did not take
a bite&mdash;and everything was ready, they opened the
door of the front passage and knelt down before the
coffin and prayed aloud, saying Our Lord's Five Wounds.</p>

<p>Then four men placed the coffin on the litter and lifted
it up and carried it out of the poor dwelling into the wood
and thence over the commons and fields and through
mountain forests.</p>

<p>And round about was the winter night and over all
hung the starry sky.</p>

<p>One more look at the empty bier-plank and then I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
quickly drew my little brother out with me; and father
and sisters also hurried after; and the elder brother
locked the door; and then the cottage in the wood lay
there in the dark and in the deepest stillness. Life had
left it&mdash;and death had left it: there is no greater loneliness
possible.</p>

<p>We heard the hum of the praying funeral procession,
we saw the flicker of the two or three lanterns among the
trunks of the trees. The bearers walked at a quick pace;
those who followed and prayed could hardly keep up with
them on the rough, snow-covered paths. I was a long
way behind with my little brother: the boy could not
walk so fast. Mother would never have left us behind
like that, when living: she would have waited, laughing
a little and chiding a little, and led the child by the hand.
Now, however, she only longed for rest.</p>

<p>Outside the parish village stands a tall cross, with a life-size
figure of the Saviour. Here, after a many-hours'
progress up and down hill, they set the coffin on the ground
and waited for the doctor, who came from the village
to view the corpse and give the death-certificate. But,
by the time that we two, who had lagged behind, came
up, the coffin-lid was hammered down again. And so I
was never able to see you again on earth, my mother!</p>

<p>They entered the parish church in the morning twilight.</p>

<p>The clear bells rang out together. A great catafalque
was set up in the middle of the dark church; many
candles gleamed; and a solemn funeral service began.
The parish priest, an old, blind man, with snow-white
hair, a venerable figure, intoned the requiem, surrounded
by priests in rich vestments. His voice was clear and
solemn; a choir chanted the responses; and trumpets
and sackbuts echoed through the church.</p>

<p>I looked at father and he at me; we knew not who had
ordered all this so. To-day I know that it was my friends
at Krieglach who gave us this beautiful token of their
love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>When the funeral service was over, the catafalque was
removed, all the festal candles on the high-altar were
lit and three priests, no longer clad in the hue of mourning,
but in red, gold-stitched chasubles, climbed the steps
of the altar and a grand High Mass was celebrated, with
gay bell-ringing and joyous music.</p>

<p>"That is because she is released from her suffering,"
said I to the boy.</p>

<p>At last, the coffin, richly decked with flowers, swayed
out of the parish church, where, in the old days, the
woodman's wife had been baptised and married, on its
way to the cemetery. The priests and the choir sang the
loud, clear requiem, the bells tolled over the village far
out into the woods and the candles flickered in the sunlight.
A long train of men and women passed through the
broad village street. We walked behind the coffin,
carrying lighted candles in our hands and praying as
we went.</p>

<p>The cemetery lies outside the village, on a gentle
eminence, between fields and meadows. It is far from
small, for the parish stretches to a great distance over hill
and dale. It is enclosed with a plank fence and contains
many crosses of wood and rusty iron; and in the middle
rises the image of Christ crucified.</p>

<p>Before this image, on the right, was the deep grave,
at the exact spot where, years ago, they had buried
our mother's two children who had died. A mound of
freshly-dug earth lay on either side of the grave.</p>

<p>Here the bearers let the coffin down to the ground and
stripped it of all its finery; and it slid down into the
pit as poor as it had left the cottage in the wood.</p>

<p>"Thou to-day, I to-morrow; and so I am content,"
murmured father.</p>

<p>And the priest said:</p>

<p>"May she rest in the Lord!"</p>

<p>Then they cast clods of earth into the grave and went
away, went to the inn, tasted bread and wine and talked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
of everyday things. When it was twelve o'clock and,
according to custom, the bells began to toll once more,
as a last farewell to the departed, the men and women
of the forest set out to return to their mountain valley.</p>

<p>We who belonged to one another sat together for a
while longer and spoke sadly of the time that must
now come and how to arrange for it. Then we took leave
of one another: my father and brothers and sisters
went home to the cottage in the wood, to live and die
where mother had lived and died.</p>

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER

WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
